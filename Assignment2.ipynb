    "### Assignment objective\n",
    "The aim of this assignment is to get familiarized with using word embedding (WE) models in practice. The assignment in total has **30 points**; it also offers **2 extra points** which can cover any missing point.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Notebook encompasses all aspects of the assignment, namely the descriptions of tasks as well as your solutions and reports. Feel free to add any required cell for solutions. The cells can contain code, reports, charts, tables, or any other material, required for the assignment. Feel free to provide the solutions in an interactive and visual way! \n",
    "\n",
    "Please discuss any unclear point in the assignment in the provided forum in MOODLE. It is also encouraged to provide answers to your peer's questions. However when submitting a post, keep in mind to avoid providing solutions. Please let the tutor(s) know shall you find any error or unclarity in the assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation & Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "The assignment should be implemented with recent versions of `Python` (>3.7). Any standard Python library can be used, so far that the library is free and can be simply installed using `pip` or `conda`. Examples of potentially useful libraries are `scikit-learn`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `gensim`, `nltk`, `spaCy`, and `AllenNLP`. Use the latest stable version of each library.\n",

    "\n",
    "Each group submits one Notebook file (`.ipynb`) through MOODLE. Do not forget to put in your names and student numbers in the first cell of the Notebook. **In the submitted Notebook, all the results and visualizations should already be present, and can be observed simply by loading the Notebook in a browser.** The Notebook must be self-contained, meaning that one can run all the cells from top to bottom without any error. If you need to include extra files in the submission, compress all files (together with the Notebook) in a `zip` file and submit the zip file to MOODLE. You do not need to include the data files in the submission.\n",

    "\n",
    "To conduct the experiments, two datasets are provided. The datasets are taken from the data of `thedeep` project, produced by the DEEP (https://www.thedeep.io) platform. The DEEP is an open-source platform, which aims to facilitate processing of textual data for international humanitarian response organizations. The platform enables the classification of text excerpts, extracted from news and reports into a set of domain specific classes. The provided dataset has 12 classes (labels) like agriculture, health, and protection. \n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between the datasets is in their sizes. We refer to these as `medium` and `small`, containing an overall number of 38,000 and 12,000 annotated text excerpts, respectively. Select one of the datasets, and use it for all of the tasks. `medium` provides more data and therefore reflects a more realistic scenario. `small` is however provided for the sake of convenience, particularly if running the experiments on your available hardware takes too long. Using `medium` is generally recommended, but from the point of view of assignment grading, there is no difference between the datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Download the dataset from [this link](https://drive.jku.at/filr/public-link/file-download/0cce88f07c9c862b017c9cfba294077a/33590/5792942781153185740/nlp2021_22_data.zip).\n",

Consider that when calculating the nearest neighbors, DO NOT use the provided functionalities of any library but implement it as the function that takes a source vector, a set of target vectors, and a $k$ parameter, and returns the $k$ nearest neighbors and their similarity scores. This function should provide an *efficient* calculation of nearest neighbors. An inefficient way (which should be avoided!) would be looping over the set of vectors in the word embedding model, and one by one calculating the cosine similarity of a source vector to each of the target vectors. As a hint for an efficient way, consider that in `numpy` (and other libraries), calculating the dot product of a vector to a matrix is much faster than the dot products of the vector to each vector of the matrix. (**3 out of 7 points for efficiency**)\n",

[Levy et al.](https://aclanthology.org/Q15-1016.pdf) [1] in Section 4.3 describe the two evaluation category of *Word Similarity* and *Analogy* tasks, reference the various datasets of each task, explain the method(s) to calculate the required quantities, and finally discribes the method to evaluate the models on the tasks. Following the descriptions in the paper, select one word similarity and one analogy dataset, download the corresponding datasets (the datasets are publicly available ‚Äì‚Äì they can also be found through the cited papers), and conduct the evaluation process on the WE model. For the analogy task, conduct the experiments using both `3CosAdd` and `3CosMul` methods. Report the evaluation results. Your results should be in the range of the ones reported in the paper (for sanity check). As before, provide your own implementation of the calculations and DO NOT use the functions of libraries.\n",
