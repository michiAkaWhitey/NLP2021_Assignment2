5427,"? On November 6, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Technical Working Group reported that food security in South Sudan is expected to improve slightly through December. Beginning in January 2018, however, food security will likely deteriorate, and Famine—IPC 5—levels of acute food insecurity remain possible during 2018 due in part to widespread insecurity and humanitarian access constraints. 5Although seasonal harvests in South Sudan could result in a slight improvement in the overall food security situation through December, the IPC Technical Working Group anticipates that food security levels will begin to deteriorate across the country from January to March 2018. By the onset of the lean season, which will likely begin three months 3 earlier than usual in January 2018, an estimated 5.1 million people could face Crisis—IPC 3—or worse levels of acute food insecurity, an increase of approximately 1.2 million people compared to the same period in 2017. In addition, the IPC Technical Working Group reports that Famine-level food insecurity could occur in multiple areas of South Sudan if widespread insecurity, restrictions on humanitarian access, extreme economic instability, and disease outbreaks continue during 2018. ? In September, USAID/FFP supported the UN World Food Program (WFP) to distribute nearly 27,000 metric tons (MT) of emergency food assistance to 2.7 million people across South Sudan, including approximately 1.8 million people in hard-to-reach areas of the country. Since January, the UN agency and its implementing partners have provided emergency food assistance to 4.6 million unique beneficiaries countrywide. ? Households across South Sudan are resorting to negative coping mechanisms—including reducing the quality and frequency of meals, selling productive assets, and depleting savings—to meet basic food needs, according to a recent WFP mobile Vulnerability Analysis and Mapping report. The study, which includes survey data from 250 households across more than 20 counties, concluded that high food prices and reduced household incomes are limiting people’s ability to meet basic food needs, even in areas where food is available in markets. The majority of households surveyed reported spending 70 percent of monthly expenditures on food, WFP reports. ? In mid-September, a multi-agency team—comprising representatives from the REACH Initiative, the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and WFP—conducted a rapid food security assessment in Western Bahr el Ghazal State’s Baggari area, Wau County. The assessment concluded that ongoing insecurity is driving internal displacement, impeding access to agricultural land and nearby markets, and forcing households to rely on wild fruits and vegetables to meet needs. Data collected in Wau’s Farajallah and Mboro towns suggest proxy global acute malnutrition (GAM) levels of 32.6 and 25.2 percent, respectively—significantly higher than the UN World Health Organization (WHO) emergency threshold of 15 percent, the REACH Initiative reports. During the assessment, UNICEF staff conducted acute malnutrition screenings for nearly 2,400 children younger than five years of age, identifying and treating nearly 680 children for acute malnutrition. ? FAO, WFP, and other humanitarian actors are collaborating with the Government of the Republic of South Sudan (GoRSS) Ministry of Agriculture to develop a response strategy to an outbreak of fall armyworm, an invasive pest that destroys maize, sorghum, and other staple crops.

9333,"CHALLENGE ACCESSING INFORMATION Risks, vulnerability and occurrence8 VERY LIMITED ACCESS TO INFORMATION ON AVAILABLE HUMANITARIAN SERVICES: only three groups (two female and one male group in Unchiprang) out of 23 FGDs knew about the existence of women’s safe spaces and PSS – some groups living less than 300 meters from such services in Kutupalong MS North and South. As for medical treatment, 10 groups out of 23 knew where medical facilities are, citing MSF eight times out of 10 (Unchiprang and zone TT). Information on medical centres and safe spaces for women is communicated through door-to-door visits and megaphone announcements, which participants in FGDs and key informants reported as good practice. The majority of FGDs and all key informants reported difficulties in getting information in the camp and women, the elderly, disabled and child-headed household being particularly vulnerable to that risk. When asked about potential solutions to support Rohingya refugees in identifying specific humanitarian services, female FGD mentioned potentially using pictures or logos of women on woman’s safe spaces, doctors on medical facilities and children on child friendly spaces. RUMOuR CONTROL AND RELIABILITY OF INFORMATION: fear of elephants stomping into settlements was mentioned by each of the FGD groups, but none of the participants knew where and when this had previously happened and therefore if this was a legitimate fear or not. Oxfam teams asked 10 of these FGD groups about rumour control and mechanisms in place to verify information, yet none of the groups knew how to verify information, since it is apparent that in large part they rely on rumours. In general, the majority of women get information from men or through speakerphones. This puts women and individuals with reduced mobility at great risk of dependence to men. RISK OF GETTING LOST IN CAMPS: most of the female FGDs reported that even if they could uphold purdah, they would not move much in the camps as they fear getting lost and there is no information disseminated in camps to indicate locations. They would prefer to stay in their own block and they are worried about their children playing out of the shelter, since they think they might get lost or be kidnapped for sex or human trafficking. Male FGDs reported that female single-headed households tend to send their children to fetch firewood, water and to buy groceries at the markets. It is not clear if the disappearance of children is due to them losing their way and having to live elsewhere in the camps or child abduction. Women suggested that signs and colours in block streets would help their movement within the camp and reduce the risk of them getting lost.",9

It can have a negative impact on children’s brain development, mental health and overall wellbeing in the long-run.”  Children who have suffered from trauma have an increased risk of delayed development, mental health disorders, depression, anxiety, self-harm and suicide, she added.  Before the earthquakes, children in PNG were already at high risk of violence and abuse. Available data indicate that girls and boys in PNG experience some of the highest rates of violence in Asia-Pacific region. About 75 per cent of children report experiences of physical abuse and about 80 per cent experience emotional abuse during their lifetime. A recent Médecins Sans Frontières report showed that 12,000 cases of family and sexual violence are treated each year in Tari Family Support Centre located in Hela Province, where the worst earthquake damage occurred.  The PNG Government estimates 270,000 people are in need of urgent assistance, including 125,000 children.

This contraction is expected to provide a favourable base effect for real growth in 2018, largely supported by non-oil activity, such as in services and manufacturing. Private consumption should also pick up as the government works to restore some of the benefits for publicsector workers that were suspended temporarily in 2016- 17. The government is stepping its drive to diversify the economy away from its dependence on oil, with its strategy outlined in the National Transformation Programme (NTP) 2020 and Vision 2030. Measures supporting the growth of non-oil revenue include expat levies and a 5% VAT introduced in January, as well as the (partial) privatization of state assets. However, the new US sanctions on Iran could disrupt its oil exports and further tighten the oil market, which is already squeezed by OPEC-led production cuts. Saudi Arabia has indicated a willingness to act as a swing producer to fill the gap. After a period of deflation that lasted for most of 2017, inflation in January 2018 reached 3%, reflecting the impact of fresh fuel and electricity subsidy cuts, which are expected to have knock-on effects on the general price level, and, more importantly, the recent introduction of VAT.

10593,"1 in 3 Afghan Children Still Not VaccinatedAn estimated 160,000 to 200,000 children under one year of age in Afghanistan ? one in three – received zero vaccinations last year.   These gaps in routine immunization coverage not only put the lives of under-vaccinated children at risk but also everyone around them.    Insecurity in parts of the country reduces access for health workers to reach children and for families to get to health clinics, while displaced populations and those living in remote areas are also more likely to miss out on vaccines.   “Immunization is the right of every child, we must accelerate our efforts to ensure all children in the country are vaccinated and protected from preventable diseases,” said Minister for Public Health, Dr Ferozuddin Feroz. “Through immunization we can protect children from diseases, such as measles, polio and pneumonia ? a major killer of children under five years of age,” Feroz added. The remarks come as Afghanistan marks, ‘World Immunization Week’, which is celebrated annually, 24-30 April, to raise awareness about the importance of vaccination and ensure that people take action to receive all required life-saving vaccines. The theme for 2018 is: “Protected Together, #VaccinesWork”. Efforts to eradicate polio also continue in Afghanistan and most of the country remains polio-free. In 2018, there have been seven polio cases, mostly restricted to high-risk areas in the southern and eastern regions. “We are seeing improvements in routine immunization coverage and new vaccines have been introduced,” said Richard Peeperkorn, WHO representative in Afghanistan.   “But the country is still behind schedule on the targets for disease eradication and elimination, including polio, measles, rubella, and maternal and neonatal tetanus. We must make more concerted efforts to reach all Global Vaccine Action Plan goals by 2020,“ Peeperkorn added.   The Global Vaccine Action Plan was endorsed by the World Health Assembly in 2012 and is a commitment to ensure that no one misses out on vital immunization by 2020.  “We must all commit to providing every child with the lifesaving vaccines they need,” said Stefano Savi, UNICEF’s deputy representative in Afghanistan.  “This includes reaching the most vulnerable children, who are often affected by conflict or living in the most remote areas of the country. Children in Afghanistan have the right to get the best start in life, to develop and progress like any child,” Savi added.    Immunization saves millions of lives globally each year and is widely recognized as one of the world’s most successful and cost-effective health interventions. Key facts and progress: The number of health centres providing immunization services increased by 12 percent to 1,767 facilities around the country.  In 2017, some 1,250,000 children, under one year old, were vaccinated against measles, polio, whooping cough, tetanus, diphtheria, pneumonia, meningitis and tuberculosis.  In 2017, 900,000 pregnant women and children younger than five were provided with medicines for antenatal care, newborn care, pneumonia, diarrhoea and meningitis.  Ten antigens are currently included in Afghanistan’s routine immunization programme, available free of charge.  From July to September 2018, a nationwide measles immunization campaign will target 14 million children, aged 10 months to five years.",4

Approximately 66 percent of protracted IDPs were found to be food insecure, compared to 43 percent in May 2016. In previous rounds of monitoring, a substantial difference in food insecurity levels were observed between more urban IDPs (in Geneina town: Ardamata, El Riad, Kirinding 1) and more rural IDPs (in Mornie, Habila and Fur Buranga). However, in May 2017, the level of food insecurity increased among sampled urban IDPs, nearly closing the gap. Household food consumption among protracted IDPs in West Darfur remained similar compared to the same time last year (May 2016). West and Central Darfur were particularly affected by increased transportation costs due to its long distance from Khartoum. Weak economic access to food was an important factor behind the food security deterioration, driven by high commodity prices and an increase in transportation costs and taxes. In addition, below average cereal production across West Darfur (confirmed in the 2017 state level post harvest assessment) affected the prices of the locally produced foods in the local food basket.

3326,"Violence in these regions is often linked to competition over land, but the recent clashes could be related to po- litical tensions stemming from the upcoming election. Devolution means that governors are now sources of sig- nificant wealth and political power, raising the chances of groups engaging in violence to secure control of the local government (Reliefweb, 27 April 2017). Memories of the 2007-2008 electoral crises that occurred through the Rift Valley and into the Western Region still concerns resi- dents. In spite a relatively peaceful elections in 2013, alle- gations of widespread voter fraud and a difficult political climate persist. Most importantly, political polarization remains tied to geography and group rather than ideology (Daily Nation, 28 June 2017). Illustrating this unease, a May 2017 poll found that 70 percent of voters expect vio- lence over the course of the upcoming campaign. Many politicians, including incumbent President Kenyatta, use ‘safety’ as a burgeoning political issue, stating opposition groups are “planning violent disruptions during the cam- paign” (Washington Times, 11 May 2017). Anticipating unrest, police in Nairobi are focussing their presence on potential political “hot spots” throughout the city, includ- ing informal settlements, and those containing dense pop- ulations of intermingling diverse groups holding varying political allegiances (Kenya Standard, 4 July 2017).",9

However, cumulative seasonal precipitation deficits remain significant in most areas, especially in the north and southwestern parts of the country. Despite increased precipitation in March and April, initial estimates from field reports indicate that area planted for rainfed wheat is smaller than last year, reflecting dry soil conditions and the use of extended areas for grazing.Maximum daily air temperatures have been above average since mid-season in most areas, and are expected to remain above average in the coming months. These abnormally high temperatures have led to early snowmelt across hydrological basins of the country, particularly in the southwest. Availability of irrigation water will be below average, and poor water availability is likely to adversely impact yields for some areas during the main season, and more broadly for second (dry) season irrigated production.• Forecasts indicate below-average to average precipitation for the remaining weeks of the spring wet season. Along with cumulative precipitation deficits, the below-average forecast is reflective of a low frequency of storms entering the region, increasing the risk for extended periods of dryness that could impact agricultural production.",0

9216,"Lassa fever is a viral haemorrhagic fever that is transmitted to humans via contact with food or household items contaminated with rodent urine or faeces. Person-to-person infections and laboratory transmission can also occur. The overall case fatality rate is 1%; it is 15% among patients hospitalized with severe illness. Early supportive care with rehydration and symptomatic treatment improves survival. The antiviral drug ribavirin seems to be an effective treatment for Lassa fever if given early on in the course of clinical illness. There is no evidence to support the role of ribavirin as post-exposure prophylactic treatment for Lassa fever. Lassa fever is known to be endemic in Benin, Guinea, Ghana, Liberia, Mali, Sierra Leone, Togo and Nigeria, and most likely exists in other West African countries.  The current Lassa fever outbreak in Nigeria shows an increasing trend in the number of cases and deaths in recent weeks with 317 confirmed cases reported in 2018 so far. This is the largest outbreak of Lassa fever ever reported in Nigeria.  The infection of 14 health care workers that were not working in Lassa fever case management centers highlights the urgent need to strengthen infection prevention and control practices in all health care setting for all patients, regardless of their presumed diagnosis. Given the high number of states affected, the clinical management will likely happen in health centers that are not appropriately prepared to care for patients affected by Lassa fever and the risk of infection in health care workers will increase.  The reporting of confirmed cases in different parts of the country and porous borders with neighbouring countries indicate a risk of spread nationally and to neighbouring countries. An overall moderate level of risk remains at the regional level. Public health actions should be focused on enhancing ongoing activities including surveillance, contact tracing, laboratory testing, and case management. Greater coordination and information sharing regarding Lassa fever cases and contacts with Benin would also contribute to rapid detection and response to cross-border spread of the outbreak",4

7423,"EVENT DESCRIPTION On 8 June 2018, the Kenya Ministry of Health reported an outbreak of Rift Valley fever (RVF) in Wajir County in the north-east of the country. The event was initially detected on 2 June 2018 when the index case, an 18-year-old male, presented to the local health facility with fever, body weakness, bleeding from the gums and mouth and other constitutional symptoms. The case-patient, who died on the day of admission, had been ill for the past five days and the bleeding diathesis had lasted three days. He (reportedly) had a history of consuming meat around 22-23 May 2018 from a camel which had been ill. On 4 June 2018, two relatives of the index case presented to the local referral hospital with high fever and bleeding from the mouth. One of the case-patients, a 25-year-old male, subsequently died on the day of admission. Blood specimens collected from the two case-patients on 4 June 2018 were shipped to the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) in Nairobi. Test results released by KEMRI on 6 June 2018 indicated that one of the two specimens tested positive for RVF. As of 8 June 2018, a total of 10 suspected RVF cases, including five deaths (case fatality rate 50%), have been reported in Wajir County. Three case-patients have since recovered and been discharged, while one remains in admission at Wajir County Referral hospital. Eight additional blood specimens have been obtained and are being analysed at the KEMRI. The Kenya Ministry of Livestock reported a high number of deaths and abortions among animals (especially camels and goats) occurring in the last two months in four counties: Kadjiado (bordering Tanzania), Kitui (east of Nairobi), Marsabit (bordering Ethiopia), and Wajir (bordering Ethiopia and Somalia).

3184,"This situation follows a very bad 2017-2018 agro-pastoral season arising from severe drought. A significant rainfall deficit (less than 32 percent compared to 20162 ) as well as a poor spatial-temporal distribution of rains have had disastrous consequences on agriculture and livestock, mainly affecting the vulnerable agro-pastoralists of southern Mauritania. This had an impact on all the wilayas (provinces) particularly during the months of July, August and September, which normally constitute the rainiest period favouring the development of the herbaceous carpet and seedling success. The early arrival of the rains in June which then ceased throughout the month of July, led to the failure of planting, the disappearance of grass and, in most areas3 , the drying up of soils. The main consequences for agriculture and livestock are: • Agricultural productions 4 for the year 2017-2018 is down by three percent compared to the 2016-2017 crop year and 11 percent above the average of the last five years (gross production of 298,265 tonnes all speculations combined against 333,936 tonnes for the average of the last five years and 306,448 tonnes in 2016-2017); • Pastures are highly affected by this deficit. The biomass production is currently below the historical average for most wilayas, and at times their production is comparable or worse than that of 20115 . As a result, the transhumance of herds started early this year with significant movements of livestock registered in October in the interior of the country, from the north to the southern refuge areas and outside, close to the neighbouring countries.

This is consistent with FGD findings, which suggest that although the host community reportedly shared their land with IDPs, the acreages were often too small to cultivate enough to sustain the HHs. In addition to reduced access to land, localized dry spells and pests are reportedly affecting crop growth in Tambura and Source Yubu towns and outskirts. Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) reports confirm that although precipitation has been above average, localized dry spells have affected the south western part of the country.6 FGD participants indicated that the harvest yields will likely not be enough to feed the population during the lean season. With inadequate access to land for cultivation, most of the IDPs in Tambura rely on casual labour, such as collecting firewood or fetching water and selling it to shop and restaurant owners.

During the same period, some very poor will already be facing food consumption gaps. Consumption of wild foods will be intensified. Incomes will slowly deteriorate after the rice transplanting and coffee weeding; labor opportunities will decrease and by May very poor households will have limited incomes. Very poor households will employ coping strategies like intensifying basketry or relying on borrowing food/remittances between March and May. Thus, people will likely not easily meet their food needs and will likely face Crisis (IPC Phase 3) between April and May 2018. From June onwards, very poor and poor households will begin to face fewer food consumption gaps with the coming harvests. Low staple prices and more income from rice, coffee and cassava harvests and cassava planting in August will result in better purchasing power, thereby tightening the food consumption gap. The coffee harvest expected in June will likely be near normal due to favorable rainfall that in turn will provide near normal incomes for households. Therefore, most households in this livelihood zone will experience Stressed (IPC Phase 2) food security outcomes again between June and September 2018.",8
636,"Prices of staple foods remained firm or declined in March and at record or near-record highs Prices of wheat, mainly consumed in urban areas, declined in the capital, Khartoum, by more than 20 percent in March with the ongoing harvest, while prices of sorghum and millet levelled off, following the sales, at subsidized prices, by the Strategic Reserve Corporation and with an appreciation of the Sudanese Pound on the parallel market to levels closer to the official rate. A reduction in the household purchasing power due to the macro-economic deterioration is likely to have contributed to the stabilization of prices through a decline in market demand. However, prices remained at record or near-record highs after the sharp increases of the previous months, which were mainly driven by the removal of the wheat subsidies in the 2018 budget (FPMA Food Policies) and by a strong depreciation of the local currency. The exchange rate of the Sudanese Pound declined sharply in late 2017 after the international sanctions were lifted in October 2017 ending a trade embargo and unfreezing financial assets. The removal of subsidies on electricity, coupled with limited availabilities and higher prices of fuel, further increased inflationary pressures. Localized but substantial crop production shortfalls, affecting the 2017 harvest, provided further support to the prices of cereals. According to the findings of the 2017 FAO Crop and Food Supply Assessment Mission (CFSAM report), the 2017 aggregate cereal production is estimated at 5.2 million tonnes, 40 percent lower than the record 2016 output. This is mainly due to a decline in the area planted with sorghum and millet, following farmers’ decision to switch to more profitable crops and to production shortfalls in Kassala, Gedaref and North Darfur states, where the output contracted by 66-90 percent from the previous year following poor and erratic rainfall.",3

The trend of the cholera outbreak and case-fatality rate then declined during the period January to March, with the number of districts reporting suspected cholera cases dropping to 25.

Apart from transhumance, another coping strategy for breeders is to grow their own fodder, and store it in prevision for the hunger gap, in order to sustain livestock’s body condition. However, the price of bourgou (main fodder used in the targeted regions) has nearly doubled in Gao and Menaka since 2017, and has now become too expensive to represent a fair alternative to transhumance.

This contributed to a significant reduction in the case load. But last year there were still cases being reported. This means that either the campaign was not as efficient as we thought it was or there was a problem with the cold chain. But there have been other contributing factors.  The first is malnutrition. Routine immunisation and vaccination campaigns in the North-Eastern parts of Nigeria have been particularly difficult due to the insurgency. These areas have been cut off from the rest of the country. One of the consequences is that children suffer from high levels of chronic under-nutrition.

The extreme volatility of the currency, low stock of food commodities due to uncertainty of the security situation, lack of foreign currency, and supply constraints in many areas during rainy season are likely factors to increase food prices beyond seasonal levels. Furthermore, on the supply side, availability of staple foods (maize, sorghum, maize flour and field beans) at the source market of Kampala has been reported to be declining. Owing to the drought situation in parts of Uganda, the availability of staple foods at the source market will continue to be constrained and prices are thus likely to increase.

Food Consumption: In the current period, 13 out of the 16 states and FCT are in the minimal phase of food insecurity situation; 3 states are under stress while 1 is in crisis.Evolution of livelihoods: Livelihood activities in all the states are favourable except in conflict areas.Nutrition: Adamawa, Borno and Yobe States are facing nutritional challenges.The results of this analysis that identified the food and nutrition insecure areas within sixteen northern states of Nigeria and the FCT were arrived at after analyzing the food and nutrition security outcome indicators and their relevant contributing factors. The Result of the CH analysis indicates that a proportion of the population have drifted from the higher CH phases (4 to 5) of food insecurity to lower phases (1 to 3). This is attributable mainly to an improvement of the security situation, livelihood activities and scaling up of humanitarian assistance from the Government and Partners. In the current period (Oct–Dec 2017), food consumption classification indicated minimal and acceptable situations in areas less affected by the insurgency mainly in Bauchi, Benue, Gombe, Jigawa, Plateau, FCT, Niger, Kebbi, Katsina, Kaduna, Taraba, Zamfara and Sokoto States; stress situations in Kano, Yobe and Adamawa States and crisis in Borno state.

Livelihood activities in all the states except in parts of Plateau, Taraba, Benue, Zamfara, Kaduna, Adamawa, Borno and Yobe States are favourable due to increased income from cash crops sales from normal harvest in these states.

10179,"4.5 million people in need of WASH.Water shortages continue to affect pastoralists and riverine communities as well as IDPs in Lower Juba, Gedo and Galmudug regions. All water catchments and underground water tanks have dried out in most of the areas where slight rains were received during the Gu season. Shallow wells in most areas have either dried or the salinity has become very high, hence not consumable for both livestock and humans. Rural communities who lost their livestock due to drought moved to urban and semi urban settlements including IDP camps in search of basic service. They are straining existing WASH facilities such as water sources, sanitation facilities and compromising hygiene practices in these areas.It is important to not only focus on emergency short-term solutions but develop sustainable solutions to these problems. In Lower Juba, WASH gaps including access to safe and reliable water sources (especially in Afmadow district, Abdille Birole land recent liberated areas like Gobweyne, Qamqam and Bula Gudud.) were reported. Lack of access to latrines for over 5,000 families were also reported. Approximately 70 per cent of latrines within Kismayo IDP camps are full and need desludging. An influx of IDPs to Gedo (Dollow, Luuq and Belethawa districts), Mogadishu (Kaxda and Daynile districts) and Galgadud (Guricel, Abudwak, Adado, Dhusamareb) was also reported. Other IDPs from Refugee camps in Ethiopia including those who migrated from the Afder region of Ethiopia are returning. There is urgent need to provide sufficient safe quality water for these IDPs. In Gedo, the main source of drinking water for these IDPs is commercial taps which are too expensive for most of them resort to unsafe river water. Access to latrines and hygiene kits are key concerns. Open defecation and poor hygiene practices are widespread. In Middle Shabelle, due to increased river levels, flood waters have reportedly broken river banks affecting large areas of farm land and displacing residents. Some 345 households in 6 villages in Mahaday district have been affected in addition to 3, 991 households in 7 villages in Jowhar district. There is an urgent need for the provision of safe water, enhance sanitation access and undertake hygiene promotion initiatives alongside distribution of hygiene kitsThe influx of IDPs in both the rural and urban areas has resulted in increased need for emergency safe water, improved access to WASH services through rehabilitation and expansion of existing water sources. There is also need for the construction of culturally sensitive latrines to meet the needs of affected populations, distribution of hygiene kits and enhance adoption of appropriate hygiene and sanitation practices through hygiene promotion interventions.There is also needed for strengthened local capacities especially WASH committees for operation and maintenance of WASH facilities. • WASH activities need to be scaled up in rural areas to avoid further displacements and encourage IDPs to return back to their rural homes • For flood-affected communities, there is an urgent need for provision of safe water, enhanced sanitation access and hygiene promotion initiatives alongside distribution of hygiene kits.

As in 2016, administrative difficulties, physical infrastructure and local interference or attempted interference in the humanitarian aid delivery are the main factors impacting humanitarian access. These factors have been further exacerbated by armed hostilities along the Western Coast that have taken place since the beginning of the year. However, despite the above, most districts, (62%) remain either fully accessible or have low relatively low access constraints (Levels 1 and 2).

The share of the population that does not have access to a sanitation facility has steadily declined. Open defecation in Tajikistan has all but vanished, falling from 6 percent in 2005 to less than 3 percent in 2012 to just below 1 percent in 2016 (figure O.2). GBAO has the largest share of people without toilets, although in absolute terms the largest populations without toilets live in selected districts of Khatlon, Sughd, and DRS (map O.2). This overall decline was accompanied by an increase in access to flush/pour toilets and pit latrines with slab. In urban areas, the majority of the population has access to flush toilets connected to a sewage system. By 2016, this proportion had increased to 60 percent. In rural areas, the share of the population using unimproved sanitation facilities has declined, while improved sanitation has increased to 41 percent of the rural population. That said, access to flush toilets connected to a sewer system in rural areas is chronically low, at only 1.7 percent. Inequalities in access to improved sanitation are even more pronounced across regions. Dushanbe accounts for more than four-fifths of all sewer connections.",11

4840,": The water and sanitation situation in the flooded districts is alarming, especially because floodwater has filled up latrines, contaminating water sources and limiting the availability of safe drinking water. A report issued by the UN estimates that around 184,000 latrines have been washed away or totally damaged while approximately 54,000 tube wells have been partially or fully damaged. Due to contamination of water sources – especially tube wells, which are the main source of safe water in affected areas – the affected population is seeking alternative and unsafe water sources, which may lead to outbreak of water borne diseases, and exacerbate any pre-disaster health and nutrition issues. As such, provision of safe water is a pressing need. This needs to be accompanied with provision of safe water collection and storage containers. There is also a need for improving immediate and medium-term access to sanitation, including by constructing emergency latrines. Hygiene promotion, accompanied with provision of hygiene items, will be key in reducing the risk of water borne and water related diseases. Furthermore, since the floods have damaged not only people’s homes but also community and school water and sanitation facilities, after the relief phase there will be a need to rehabilitate damaged community water systems, water and sanitation facilities in schools and latrines for damaged houses. The damage to sanitation structures affects girls and women more, especially as they were already facing challenges in accessing safe and accessible sanitation and hygiene facilities prior to the floods. Girls and women have also highlighted the need for menstrual hygiene support. To address specific needs of girls and women, menstrual hygiene management in the form of culturally relevant sanitary napkins is necessary",4

In Eastern Equatoria the regional drought is causing additional strain, with low food and water availability causing population displacements. While populations would traditionally move towards northern Kenya and Ethiopia, access to these routes are currently limited due to insecurity along the Ethiopian border and drought affecting the Turkana area of Kenya. With limited options for accessing water and food, populations are now under severe strain. The most significantly affected county is Kapoeta, where at least two adults, both women, were reported to have died from hunger as they were travelling towards Kenya in search of food. The dry season in South Sudan typically lasts from November until March, though may extend as far as until May. A prolonged dry season will have devastating consequences on the already limited water and food security in the country, and will likely result in drought conditions in several states. Extremely dry weather and drought is likely to result in increased inter-communal conflict as populations migrate in search water. This is aniticipated to be a particular issue in Jonglei state, which is home to a significan cattle-keeping community. Disputes traditionally arise as a result of competition for water and pasture for livestock.The current harsh dry weather experienced in South Sudan has yet to reach drought levels, but is considered a particularly severe dry season. One exception is in Kapoeta, Eastern Equatoria, where the regional drought is having severe consequences for people and livelihoods. The drought being experienced in Kapoeta has resulted in migration of the communities with their livestock in search of water and pasture towards the borders to Uganda, Ethiopia and Kenya.This is impacting negatively on the water sources as livestock and humans compete for the limited facilities that are functional.",3

Minimal area outcomes are projected for most of the outlook period, apart from areas severely affected by dry spells and pest infestations, which will face Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes between August and September.  • Below-normal rainfall in southern and central regions of the country will result in below-average production, which will result in localized food deficits as well as reductions in income from major cash crop production for the 2018/19 consumption season.
