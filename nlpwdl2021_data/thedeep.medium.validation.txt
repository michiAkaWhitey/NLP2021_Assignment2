19043,"Cyclone Ava made landfall in Madagascar on January 5th. Flooding caused major damage to crops and agricultural infrastructure, and caused the Soavina dam to break, which flooded around 30 percent of the rice fields in Haute Matsiatra and Vakinakaratra Regions. Because these crops were young the chance of their recovery is small, but some more mature crops were also lost. In the Southeast, farmers are delaying the transplanting of the main season rice (Vatomandry rice) until the end of the cyclonic season, with seeds mainly sown in upland areas. In the South, rain from the cyclone was favorable to maize and sweet potato crops, which are expected to be harvested beginning in February.  Agricultural labor opportunities have intensified in the central highlands to salvage non-damaged crops in affected fields. Labor mainly consists of desilting, opening drainage channels to bring out the water and replanting young rice plants. Some up-lands in Vakinakaratra and Vatovavy Fitovinany are also currently labored to expand rice fields to escape from eventual future floods. Wages remain stable between 2,500 Ariary and 4,000 Ariary per day depending on the field size.  Following the passing of the cyclone, market supplies from Antananarivo were interrupted by road washouts for about one week in the Southern Highlands and Southeastern regions of Madagascar, which led to rice prices increasing by up to 17 percent compared to before the cyclone. All markets are now functioning well. Tuber supplies have slightly reduced with the exhausting stock of sweet potatoes and the slowing of dried cassava sales, while cereal supplies have increased following the harvest of first season rice and green maize. Rice prices are 20 percent higher than last year and is 35 percent above the 5-year average. Maize prices have increased despite the new harvest, while prices of tubers remain stable.  Despite recent rains favorable to maize and sweet potato crops, and the relative stability of prices, the situation in the Extreme South (MG 24) and the Southwest Madagascar (MG 23) remains in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) in January. Household income remains low due to below normal production but no major animal sales nor other emergency coping strategies were reported.  The situation in Southeast Madagascar has deteriorated despite the recovery from last year’s rainfall deficit and the improved first harvest of rice. The current lean season began earlier with insufficient stocks from first production, low income from cash crop production, and loss of substitute foods. Three districts (Nosy Varika, Mananjary, and Vohipeno) out of 6 in MG19 will be in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) level of acute food insecurity this month and the remaining three (Farafangana, Manakara and Vangaindrano) will remain in Stressed (IPC Phase 2).",3

The main farming activity is the planting of crops, occupying more than 78 percent of farming villages. As usual, it is a time of good livelihood opportunities for poor households earning average incomes enabling them to maintain good food security conditions, which will keep acute food insecurity at Minimal (IPC Phase 1) levels through at least January 2018 in crop-growing areas. ? However, the rains are getting off to an extremely slow start in pastoral areas, which are feeling the effects of a protracted lean season. This is creating added financial costs for maintaining livestock herds, whose poor physical condition and prices are curtailing the food access of poor households. The definitive establishment of the rains by the end of July could improve food security conditions, easing current Stressed (IPC Phase 2) levels of food insecurity down to Minimal (IPC Phase 1) levels as of August for most households in the pastoral zone. ? There were low cereal supplies on most markets in the month of June with the limited flow of imports from Nigeria due to continued restrictions and the higher prices on source markets in that country. Demand is rising in line with normal seasonal trends, fueled by needs for seeds for rainfed crops, for the Ramadan fast, and for the replenishment of the food stocks of returning transhumant pastoralists. This has sharply increased prices, driving them more than 25 percent above the five-year average on certain markets such as Maradi, Zinder, and Agadez. ? The ongoing security crisis disrupting normal market operations and major livelihoods such as fishing and the sale of peppers and livestock will prolong the current Crisis (IPC Phase 3) levels of acute food insecurity in the Diffa region through at least January 2018.

17984,"Introduction: The Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak in the island nation of Cabo Verde was of unprecedented magnitude in Africa and the first to be associated with microcephaly in the continent. Methods: Using a simple mathematical framework we present a first epidemiological assessment of attack and observation rates from 7,580 ZIKV notified cases and 18 microcephaly reports between July 2015 and May 2016. Results: In line with observations from the Americas and elsewhere, the single-wave Cabo Verdean ZIKV epidemic was characterized by a basic reproductive number of 1.85 (95% CI, 1.5 – 2.2), with overall the attack rate of 51.1% (range 42.1 – 61.1) and observation rate of 2.7% (range 2.29 – 3.33). Conclusion: Current herd-immunity may not be sufficient to prevent future small-to-medium epidemics in Cabo Verde. Together with a small observation rate, these results highlight the need for rapid and integrated epidemiological, molecular and genomic surveillance to tackle forthcoming outbreaks of ZIKV and other arboviruses",4

The UN Food and Agriculture Organization has already issued a special report warning of extreme risk to 2017 food production in North Korea. The main cereal production areas of North Korea are affected. “All in all, the 2017 growing season has been very challenging for North Korean agricultural producers,” Dinville concluded. “With the impact observed throughout the growing season and the widespread nature of the impact, food supplies will very likely be substantially diminished. The impact of further sanctions and food security will likely bring further challenges to the situation in North Korea.”",3

And most of the health facilities that re-opened can only attend to emergency services.  - It is worth noting that low immunization coverage was an existing condition prior to the earthquake with several provinces in the highlands already facing malaria and measles outbreaks. According to the National Department of Health (NDOH), about 70-80 per cent of children in the severely-affected provinces are not protected against preventable diseases   - Before the emergency, around half of children under-five were chronically malnourished - the highest rate in Asia and the Pacific and fourth worst in the world - and around 15 per cent of children suffer from acute malnutrition, with 2.6 per cent considered severe.  Severe wasting is estimated to increase up to 4 percent.

In February 2018, UNICEF distributed 7,576 cartons of Ready-To-Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF) across thirteen counties through the Kenya Essential Medical Supplies Authority. UNICEF supported coverage surveys to assess access to treatment for acute malnutrition in Turkana, Mandera, Tana River, Wajir Garissa and Baringo counties. Four of the counties had coverage well above the SPHERE standard of 50% (Turkana West 67.5%, Mandera 66.3%, Garissa 62.7%, Wajir, Turkana North and Turkana East have the same level of coverage each at 59.6%) while East Pokot and Tana River were at 45.9% and Tana River 48%. Key barriers identified include distance, mother’s workload, lack of awareness about the program and lack of awareness about the child’s nutritional status. The insecurity in East Pokot has contributed to the low coverage. Coverage improvement plans have been developed for each of the counties as the last step of the coverage survey. According to the Short Rains Assessment (Jan/Feb 2018) nutrition surveys supported by UNICEF, the overall nutrition situation has improved compared to 6 months ago. According to the Integrated Phase Classification (IPC) for Acute Malnutrition conducted in February 2018, the levels of acute malnutrition remain at Critical levels (Phase 4; GAM WHZ 15.0 - 29.9 percent) in Turkana Central, North, West and South, Tana River, Wajir North, North Horr and Laisamis sub-counties.

18065,"The outbreak of dengue fever in Burkina Faso continues to spread, particularly in the central region of the country, which contains the capital city of Ouagadougou. In week 45 (week ending 11 November 2017), the incidence of dengue declined slightly in the central region of the country, with 35.2 cases per 100 000 people as compared to 43.2 cases per 100 000 people in week 44. For the 12 other regions of the country, the incidence also decreased from 3.8 cases per 100 000 in Week 44 to 3.2 cases per 100 000 in week 45. In week 45, 1 502 suspected cases, and 1 death, were reported. Cases are currently reported in all 13 health regions of the country. Most (61%) of the suspected cases reported since the beginning of the year have been from the central region of the country, and in week 45, 64% (967) of cases and 1 death were reported from this region.  From epidemiological week 1 through week 45 in 2017, 12 087 suspected cases including 7 418 probable cases (positive for dengue rapid diagnostic test) have been reported in the country. Twenty-four deaths have occurred (case fatality rate 0.2%). Samples collected from suspected cases have been referred for PCR testing at the viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF) reference laboratory of the Centre Muraz, Bobo-Dioulasso. Characterization of samples has identified three dengue virus serotypes: DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-1, with DEN-2 predominating (74%). PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIONS The response to the outbreak continues to be coordinated by the National Epidemic Management Committee and a response plan has been developed and implemented since the beginning of the outbreak. WHO has facilitated a series of meetings (most recently 8 November 2017) to coordinate partners regarding the locations and financing of interventions. Regional health centres and hospitals have been provided with 1 500 rapid diagnostic tests with support from the government of Burkina Faso and the World Bank. Case investigation and supervision of surveillance and of case management has been initiated in five health regions (Hauts-Bassins, CentreOuest, Centre-Ouest, Centre-Nord, Nord, Sahel and Centre). Surveillance and case management has been strengthened by making treatment guides and posters with the dengue diagnosis algorithm available to healthcare providers. The capacity of the national reference hospital in Ouagadougou for case management of severe cases has been strengthened via the increase in staff capacity through the support of MSF and provision of medication as well as training of laboratory staff. A short radio and television programme about dengue was developed and information about dengue has been disseminated via social media. Spatial spraying of sites with high densities of Aedes aegypti in Ouagadougou has been ongoing since 21 October 2017 and is planned through 30 November 2017, with 122 sites targeted for spraying. 5 500 community volunteers have been trained and are currently implementing a campaign of community sensitization, identification, and destruction of mosquito breeding sites in households in Ouagadougou. Two rounds of entomological investigations began on 14 November 2017 to assess dengue vector surveillance indicators are planned for the four most affected regions, with technical and financial support from WHO. These will continue until 8 December 2017 in Ouagadougou and the Centre Ouest, Centre Est, and Centre Nord regions. Orientation has been provided to the press, and municipal and community leaders to increase their coverage of this event and the accuracy of messages disseminated regarding dengue fever prevention and control. SITUATION INTERPRETATION Although the dengue fever incidence in Burkina Faso has decreased in recent weeks, there is a need for continued surveillance and response. Specifically, there is a lack of financial resources to continue vector control activities, including the campaign currently ongoing in Ouagadougou, the area most affected by the outbreak. Active surveillance, effective vector control, case management, and social mobilization are particularly critical for the control of this outbreak. Coordination with WHO partners to mobilize resources to support the response is needed. Current vector control efforts need to be expanded to affected areas outside Ouagadougou in order to effectively address the outbreak on a national scale. 12 087 C",4

16160,"The Nigeria Education sector estimates that 2.8 million school-aged children and education personnel are in need of emergency education support in Borno, Yobe and Adamawa states. Since the start of the crisis, more than 700,000 children between the ages of 6 and 17 have been displaced in these three states. The recent crisis in north-east Nigeria has put pressure on an education system that was already poor before the start of the conflict. In 2015, more than 75 per cent of children in Yobe and Borno states were out of school, compared to 24 per cent in the rest of Nigeria24. There are multiple barriers for children to access education. A critical one is the inability for parents to support the cost of learning materials and the charges levied in schools, due to loss of assets and livelihoods during the crisis. Additional barriers include the poor quality of education mainly due to a lack of adequately trained teachers, a lack of teaching and learning materials, insufficient or overcrowded classrooms, and inadequate WASH facilities. Throughout the crisis, especially between 2009 and 2015, education has been the object of deliberate and systematic attacks by nonstate armed groups, leading to loss of life and property and weakening an already fragile education system. In the period between 2012 and 2016, more than 600 teachers were reportedly killed in attacks, while more than 19,000 were displaced. A primary school was deliberately attacked on 30 November 2017 with casualties among children. Children and teachers in all three affected states are in dire need of psycho-social support to cope with the negative effects of the conflict. There is an urgent need to engage the local communities in supporting education as a longer term strategy for recovery and peacebuilding. Preliminary findings of the joint education needs assessment conducted in November 2017 show that parents see education as an opportunity for better job prospects as well as preventing idleness or troublemaking and building their child’s character. Lessons from the past should encourage all stakeholders to realise that a stable and prosperous north-east will depend on ensuring that all children and adolescents have access to quality and inclusive education.",8

The average prevalence of wasting across all four study areas increased from 9.1 percent during the post-harvest season to 14.3 percent during the lean season. The variation was particularly pronounced in the agropastoral livelihood zone.  Although there were no marked differences in the prevalence of child stunting by region, livelihood zone or season, the average prevalence at both time points exceeded 60 percent. Such levels are alarmingly high and call for intensified efforts to prevent chronic undernutrition. Household food insecurity, as defined by the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale or Food Consumption Score, was not independently associated with the odds of being wasted or becoming wasted. In a typical year, the prevalence of child wasting is a poor indicator of the household food security situation. High levels of wasting do not automatically imply a food security crisis.

He noted that the Government had not resumed interaction with OHCHR since it had suspended it in mid-October 2016 adding that the Commission of Inquiry on the human rights situation there regretted the lack of Government cooperation and access to the country.  “The Commission of Inquiry has collected more than 470 testimonies of human rights violations allegedly committed in Burundi since 2015,” to be presented in its final report to the Human Rights Council in September, Mr. Zerihoun said.  Given the current climate, implementation of proposals contained in a 12 May report of the National Commission for the Inter-Burundian Dialogue would likely lead to an escalation of the crisis, he said.  That report – which affirmed that a majority in Burundi supported a revision of the Constitution, a lifting of presidential term limits and changes to other provisions of the Arusha Agreement – had been denounced by opposition parties, as had the subsequent creation of a constitutional review commission.

33761,"Gu production is expected to be around 50 percent of average as a result of below-average and poorly distributed April to June rainfall in agropastoral areas of Hiraan, Bakool, Gedo, Lower Shabelle, and Middle Shabelle. Production is expected to be only slightly better in Bay, around 50-70 percent of average. Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and Emergency (IPC Phase 4) outcomes are likely among poor households in these areas until the Deyr harvest in January, with the greatest food insecurity expected after September, when households exhaust stocks.- In Northwestern Agropastoral livelihood zone, preliminary estimates indicate that August Gu harvests and November Karan long-cycle sorghum harvests will both be well below average. However, farmers are atypically planting short-cycle sorghum in July and the harvest of these crops in November will increase total production. Poor households will rely on the consumption of harvests and the sale of horticultural crops to meet their basic food needs throughout the outlook period. However, many will sell a high proportion of crops to repay debts and will remain Stressed (IPC Phase 2).- Local staple food prices remain below 2011 levels, but well above average. In Baidoa, the retail price of sorghum reached 10,300 SOS/kg in June, 95 percent above average and the highest June price since 2011. The retail price of maize in Qorioley in June was 10,750 SOS/kg, 50 percent above average and also the highest June price since 2011. Sustained high prices are attributed to below-average production in 2016 and traders withholding stocks from markets until August/September, when prices will be higher.- In most pastoral livelihood zones of Middle and Lower Juba, rainfall in mid-June and July improved pasture and water resources, which supported livestock body improvements. Despite the influx of livestock from Gedo, Bay, and Lower Shabelle, average pasture conditions are expected to sustain normal migration patterns throughout the July-September Xagaa season. Poor pastoralists from these regions will have increased access to milk and saleable livestock, and Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes are expected throughout the outlook period.- According to the Food Security Cluster (FSC), humanitarian organizations will distribute large-scale emergency assistance through December, targeting 1 million beneficiaries in August and 400,000-600,000 a month from September to December.

13260,"One fifth of households (20%) has had to change their water source from what is normal for the season. The main reason given by this group for the change was that too many people accessing the same source (70%), the source had dried up (43%) and or the quality of the supply (43%). These issues were reflected in focus group discussions. The main problems reported at the crowded sources as: ? Long queues and extended waiting times, leading to people queuing from the early morning and waiting long periods during the day. ? Reduced water volume. The upstream tanks take time to refill once empty so only so much can be collected within a given time period. This further extends waiting times and limits collection to certain times of day. ? As volume of water reduces the water quality gets worse leading to a choice of dirty/muddy water, a long wait or no water at all. When asked what they will do if their water source dries up households said that they will strive to find ways to find water such as creating/digging a new water source within the community, or if they have to find it elsewhere, walking at least one kilometre away from where they live.

Cropping activities will continue to provide below-average agricultural wage labor activities through February, prompting an increased reliance on charcoal and firewood sales, petty trade, remittances, and safety nets. It is likely that due to a combination of poor rainfall and the Fall Armyworm infestation, the maize and bean harvest will be below average, notably in Kilifi, Kitui, and Makueni. Regardless, the harvest is expected to restore household stocks, lessen market dependence, and improve incomes. Depending on production levels, malnutrition of children under five years of age is likely to reduce slightly. Since the short rains is the main season in the southeastern marginal agricultural areas, the harvest is still expected to provide substantial amounts of drought -tolerant crops, which will support generally average food consumption and dietary diversity through May 2018. With the forecasted below-average long rains, agricultural wage labor is likely to continue to be below normal for the next season. In April, the rains will likely bring improvements in pasture, browse, and water availability, leading to better livestock body conditions and productivity. However, for the small number of poor households that already sold their milking herd in Tharaka and northern Meru before the October rains began, and in the areas that experienced poor short rains, below-average milk production is expected through May. From February with the harvest, the majority of poor households in the marginal agricultural areas will move to None (IPC Phase 1) acute food insecurity.

25819,"The extremely dry winter has affected 22 provinces across Afghanistan and now threatens to negatively impact the lives of one million people, with an additional two million who could feel its effects over the coming months.  Food insecurity and reduced access to safe water are beginning to take their toll in the 10 worst affected provinces, where 20 to 30 percent of water sources are reportedly dry. The impact on children could be devastating, as these areas have pre-existing high rates of malnutrition. Without adequate nutritious food and safe water for drinking, as well as for hygiene and sanitation, children’s health will only worsen.  “The priority is to prevent the situation from deteriorating, by responding to the needs of children and families in the worst affected areas,” said Adele Khodr, UNICEF Representative in Afghanistan. “Children across the country already face numerous challenges and now they have to cope with this latest threat to their lives,” Khodr added.  The impact of the drought couldn’t come at a worse time, as cases of severe acute malnutrition – seasonal malnutrition – rise on average by about 25 percent each year in the coming summer months. Some 1.6 million children and 443,000 pregnant and lactating women suffer from malnutrition across Afghanistan.  “Preventing malnutrition is already a priority in Afghanistan,” said Khodr. “We need to make sure that children and families get the access to nutritious food, safe water and health services that they need. The impact of malnutrition can last a lifetime, which is why it’s critical that we identify and treat at risk children now,” Khodr added.  A drought emergency task force has been set up by the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan to coordinate and align the response across all sectors, including education, nutrition, water, sanitation and hygiene, food security and agriculture.  UNICEF and partners in the nutrition cluster estimate that emergency nutrition assistance is needed for 92,000 children and 8,500 pregnant and lactating women. UNICEF estimates also show that between July and December 2018, some 121,000 acutely malnourished children under five and 33,000 pregnant and lactating women could need life-saving nutrition services.  The UNICEF led water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) cluster has indicated that some 875,000 people could need assistance in the next three to six months. UNICEF and partners are scaling up their operations to respond to the emergency nutrition and WASH needs.  An estimated 100 families from the Bala Murghab district of Badghis have been forced to move to Herat to find alternative work due to failed crops, and to access safe drinking water. The situation is further complicated, as a result of escalating conflict that often occurs at this time of year, leading to increased displacement and reduced access for humanitarian workers.  Among the affected provinces, Bagdhish, Bamyan, Daykundi, Ghor, Helmand, Kandahar, Jawzjan, Nangarhar, Nimroz, Nuristan, Takhar, and Uruzgan are of critical priority for nutrition and water, sanitation and hygiene assistance.  Thirteen provinces, out of a country total of 34 provinces, received less than 30 percent of their average annual precipitation in the period October 2017 to end February 2018.  UNICEF Afghanistan is calling for an additional US$10 million to respond to the needs of children and their families. This includes to:  • Provide safe water for 200,000 people and hygiene assistance, including chemicals for water treatment and hygiene kits.  • Reach 65,000 children with essential lifesaving nutrition assistance through:  procuring and pre-positioning essential nutrition suppliesscaling up emergency nutrition services through fixed and mobile nutrition teams that can provide broader health services at the same time.strengthening community screening and referrals of malnourished children to provide treatment as quickly as possible.scaling up the Vitamin A supplementation programme for children in drought affected provinces.UNICEF also calls on all parties to the conflict to provide safe access for families seeking essential health services and for humanitarian workers to reach children and families in need of lifesaving support.

Overall, the proportion of food insecure IDPs in South Darfur increased from 46 to 63 percent during this period. Among the reasons for the deterioration was poor economic access due to increasing prices, in addition to the poor harvest, especially in the localities of South and North of Nyala, Kass and Beleil (according to the 2017 state level post harvest assessment), which resulted in IDP households being more reliant on markets and fewer job opportunities. Food insecurity was especially prevalent among IDPs in Kass and Gereida, with above 80 percent of households being food insecure. The deterioration in Kass camp was noteworthy: The proportion of food insecure households increase by 56 percentage points compared with May 2016. Food security improved among IDPs in the Otash and Deriege cluster compared to same period last year. The improvement may be partially a result of the recent implementation of cash-based food assistance, which allows households to have more food choices. In addition, both camps in the cluster are part of Nyala town with greater access to job opportunities.

16126," ISLAMABAD — Fresh fighting in northern Afghanistan has disrupted the electric supply to Kabul and several provinces for the second time in less than three weeks.  The hostilities come as the country's Independent Election Commission (IEC) on Saturday launched a long-delayed voters' registration process for parliamentary and district council elections scheduled for October 20.  A provincial police spokesman told VOA that a team of technicians from the state-owned electricity department has arrived in the Baghlan province to assess the damage and carry out the repair work, but heavy fighting prevented them from reaching the site in Dushi district.  Officials said the overnight destruction of the electricity tower plunged a vast area into darkness, including much of the Afghan capital, a city of more than 5 million people.Residents and businesses in Kabul said Saturday they were relying on private generators to run critical operations.  Transmission lines passing through Baghlan are used to import about 300 megawatts of electricity from neighboring Central Asian states of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.  The Taliban controls or contests several districts in the Afghan province and routinely launches attacks on security forces in government-controlled areas.  Last month, insurgents also had blown up a major electricity tower in the Kelagai area of Baghlan, cutting the power supply to Kabul and many Afghan provinces for several days.  The Taliban had justified their action at the time, saying the government was blocking supply of electricity to insurgent-controlled areas.  Separately, officials confirmed Saturday that an overnight Taliban attack in the western city of Farah killed at least seven Afghan soldiers and wounded several others.  Afghan President Ashraf Ghani on Saturday repeated his offer of peace talks for the Taliban and invited them to register as a political group to join the parliamentary elections for seeking resolution of their disagreements.  Ghani spoke shortly after launching the voters' registration process at the presidential place in Kabul. The two-months long exercise will enable the country to create for the first time in its history formal voters' lists — a move likely to address allegations of fraud and rigging, according to Afghan officials.  'We have placed before the Taliban a clear and comprehensive peace plan.If they believe in the betterment of the Afghan nation they should accept it and come to contest the elections,' said the president.  Ghani was referring to his offer of unconditional peace talk she announced in February at an international conference in Kabul. His initiative received widespread domestic and international backing.  The Taliban so far has not publicly offered any reaction to the peace overture, however, and instead has intensified battlefield attacks across Afghanistan.",1

In some areas of Southern Somali Region (Liben, Gode and Korahe zones), significant rains were received only in the last dekad of April and in the first dekad of May, and the cumulative seasonal rainfall was up to 60 percent below average.In addition, improvements are expected to be short-lived as rains tapered off from mid-May and the dry season already started in June. The severe forage and water deficits resulted in extremely poor livestock body conditions, high animal mortality rates and a sharp decline of milk production. With the next rainy season starting in October, rangeland and livestock conditions are expected to further deteriorate in the coming months.",3

10016,"February to May 2018: Apart from the increased availability of green food in February, the majority of poor households are likely to continue relying on a range of typical livelihood and coping strategies to meet their minimum food needs. The atypically low maize prices expected through May should more easily facilitate needed market food purchases . As the harvests start (ranging from March in the south to late April in the far north) , most poor households will gradually reduce their dependency on coping strategies and market purchases to meet their food needs. At the peak of the lean season, FEWS NET estimates that the number of food insecure people facing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) acute food insecurity will be well below the five -year average, including potential flood or cyclone-affected people, who may require emergency food assistance depending on the magnitude of the disaster. From April onwards, with the availability of harvested crops, most poor households , including those in Chemba District, are expected to be accessing food from their own production and their acute food insecurity outcomes will lessen and are likely to range from either Stressed (IPC Phase 2) to None (IPC Phase 1), depending on the severity of their previous situation. At this stage of the 2017/18 cropping season, it is still too early to determine specific areas of below-average production. However, if there is a localized poor harvest in April, this is not likely to have a significant impact during the scenario period through May 2018, but could potentially later when household stocks deplete earlier than normal . The forecast for enhanced cyclonic activity and above-average rainfall could cause localized flooding in some of the major basins. Depending on the extent of any flooding, which is possible through March, some flood -affected households may still face food gaps until they recover through post-flood production in May/June. ",3

Being the third consecutive belowaverage rainfall season, the modest recovery conditions in some parts of ASALs are likely to be short-lived. Therefore, the upcoming dry season (June to September) will be a difficult one for the ASALs in terms of malnutrition, access to water and food, particularly for pastoral communities. Insecurity linked to resource-based conflicts has worsened, while Fall Armyworm and African Armyworm infestations continue to threaten crops in marginal agricultural counties, further worsening the prospects for the next harvest",3

9357,"The cholera outbreak in Tanzania Mainland has escalated in recent weeks. In week 20 (week ending 20 May 2018), a total of 249 new suspected cholera cases with eight deaths (case fatality rate 3.2%) have been reported, compared to 44 cases and zero deaths reported in week 19. This reflects over 5-fold-increase in the weekly incidence.  The new cases came from five districts: Sumbawanga (109 cases and 4 deaths), Ngorongoro (100 cases and 4 deaths), Longido (28 cases), Monduli (11), and Songwe (1). Several of the reported cases are historical cases reported late, a phenomenon being seen across all the active regions.   From 1 January 2018 to 20 May 2018, a cumulative of 2 105 suspected cholera cases, including 44 deaths (case fatality rate 2.1%), have been reported in Tanzania Mainland. Three out of 26 regions currently have active transmission, namely Arusha, Rukwa and Songwe. Zanzibar Island continues to report zero cholera cases, with the last case reported on 11 July 2017.   PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIONS Surveillance activities are ongoing in the affected districts and regions. All acute watery diarrhoea cases are being monitored, with laboratory testing to rapidly detect cholera. Water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) activities are being implemented, including bulk chlorination of water supplied by water vendors and monitoring of the free residual chlorine at the point of collection. Risk communication and social mobilization interventions are ongoing at community level, including sensitization and awareness creation through local radio, national television and social media.  SITUATION INTERPRETATION The outbreak of cholera in Tanzania Mainland is getting worse, with a rapid increase in the number of new cases seen in recent weeks. The ongoing heavy seasonal rain is facilitating the transmission of infection, unhindered by any concrete response on the ground. This cholera outbreak requires drastic actions from the national authorities and partners to bring it under control. The first step, however, is to give it a high priority. Adequate resources, including funds, logistics and technical human capacity, should then be committed, coming both locally and from the global partners.",4

The situation of SAM among children is particularly precarious in four out of 13 regions (Sahel, East, Centre-North and North), representing 49% of the national caseload. The 2018 lean season is expected to be challenging due to rain shortfalls in the Sahel and poor availability of biomass.

27432,"Members of this recently displaced population are going home, but in many cases it is much too soon. Physical safety is the most fundamental problem: areas of return, especially the ones most recently taken from ISIS, are heavily contaminated with improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and mines. There is widespread fear of revenge and retribution killings by and of religious and political groups that perceive others to be their enemies. Moreover, potential returnees are sometimes unwelcome by security forces and local authorities who are unwilling to protect people they consider their opponents, or sympathizers with their opponents.The basic necessities of daily life are hard to come by while displaced, and even more so upon return. Shelter is practically non-existent in some of the areas most damaged by ISIS and by the fight to rout ISIS, access to clean water is a challenge for both IDPs and returnees, and medical services and electricity are not readily available in many places. Earning money to pay for the materials and services so crucial for returnees is hardly possible until the nascent reconstruction of Iraq begins bearing fruit. In the midst of this situation in which humanitarian needs are difficult to address, some IDPs are returning spontaneously simply because they are tired of being displaced. Others are being encouraged or pressed to return by de facto incentives like salaries, compensation for lost property, and promises of non-food items (NFIs) and building materials to start over, or in some cases, by outright eviction. Faced with poor conditions and a lack of protection in many of the IDP camps and settlements, such offers and pressures can be hard to resist, even when security conditions are questionable and the elements of a dignified return are not in place. Given that the fight against ISIS continues and Iraq faces an ongoing economic crisis, the Iraqi government has not been able to designate significant funding for humanitarian assistance to the displaced nor ensure that returns occur only when people feel ready. Even while the debate about safe returns occurs, internal displacement continues, both because of ongoing fighting and because people who cannot go home are sometimes being sent to new locations: in some places,the local governments are insisting that IDPs must leave, sometimes in order to make room for newer, more vulnerable people, and sometimes for reasons known only to themselves. These attempts to orchestrate returns according to ideas other than the generally-accepted international standards have the potential to leave vulnerable people even more exposed to risk, further destabilize Iraq, and make the country’s reconstruction even more challenging.",10

Rice output for 2017 is estimated to increase marginally to 520 000 tonnes, still below average, mainly reflecting problems with water availabilities as irrigation reservoir levels had not fully recovered from the drought events in 2015 and 2016.",3
13364,"Conflict, displacement, and economic decline are placing severe pressure on essential basic services and the institutions that provide them, pushing them towards total collapse. Humanitarian programmes in Yemen are predicated on an assumption of at least minimal functionality of state services in key sectors like health, water, education and social protection. However, growing evidence points to imminent institutional collapse across large swathes of the country. The Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation (MOPIC) in Sana’a reports that Central Bank foreign exchange reserves dropped from $4.7 billion in late 2014 to less than $1 billion in September 2016. The public budget deficit has nearly doubled in the last year, to about $1.8 billion. Salaries for health facility staff, teachers and other public sector workers go increasingly unpaid, leaving 1.25 million state employees and their 6.9 million dependents – or nearly 30 per cent of the population – without an income at a time of shortages and rising prices. Despite Government commitments to the contrary, relocation of the Central Bank to Aden had not resolved salary arrears as of late October. State-provided social services are rapidly collapsing while needs are surging. In August, the Ministry of Public Health and Population (MOPHP) in Sana’a announced it could no longer cover operational costs for health services. As of October 2016, only 45 per cent of health facilities were functional; this rate falls below 25 per cent  in five governorates, including Marib, Al Jawf and Al Dhale’e. Absenteeism among key staff – doctors, nutrition counsellors, teachers – is reportedly rising as employees seek alternatives to provide for their families. On top of pressure to compensate for a faltering commercial sector, humanitarian partners are fielding calls to fill gaps created by collapsing public institutions, which is beyond both their capacity and remit. It is essential for all stakeholders to stem this collapse, including through selective re-engagement of development programmes, which have been largely frozen since early 2015. ",4

Household food consumption is reduced and local households have large food consumption gaps due to the pressure on household food availability from displaced populations. The market disruptions from the recent aggression by Boko Haram (the attack on Kaïga on May 5, 2017) have slowed the flow of food and livestock trade, limiting supplies on certain markets.

More than 270,000 people, including 125,000 children, have been left in immediate need of life-saving assistance. Since the initial 26 February earthquake, at least 195 aftershocks have occurred, of which six were of a 6.0 or greater magnitude.   The latest tracking figures available from the Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) implemented as part of the Shelter Cluster response, indicate that 11,041 households (42,577 people) remain displaced due to the earthquake, of which 1,252 households (24 per cent) are displaced in nine care centres while 9,789 households remain within their communities. The number of people registered as staying in care centres continues to fluctuate, and the overall number of displaced may rise as new assessments are carried out .   The Shelter Cluster has adopted common definitions of settlement types defining a care centre as a displacement site where people are hosted away from their community or area of origin , and affected community as a community where people are still living within their community, even if displaced locally from their damaged/destroyed home.

The Food Security Cluster advises that affected households still living in their communities and thereby having access to land should also be supported with agriculture and other recovery kits, and that this could help promote return of other displaced people.   More than 80 per cent of health facilities in Hela and Southern Highlands (69 of 86) are open and functional, but 13 of these health facilities sustained severe structural damage that continues to pose serious occupational threats to all users. Refurbishment of earthquake related structural damages remains a challenge. In particular, 55 per cent of health facilities urgently need access to safe water sources.   Traditional water sources were destroyed by earthquake-induced landslides and landslips. Water quality testing is already underway, with capacity to sample and test water in sources suspected to be contaminated established in Southern Highlands province. The Health Cluster reports that the results of the water testing of the Kikori River in Gulf province showed no heavy metal contamination. However, bacteriological analysis showed heavy coliform presence which may result in water -borne diseases. The lack of access to safe drinking water significantly increases risks of water-borne diseases outbreak among affected and displaced persons.

2674,"Gu production is expected to be around 50 percent of average as a result of below-average and poorly distributed April to June rainfall in agropastoral areas of Hiraan, Bakool, Gedo, Lower Shabelle, and Middle Shabelle. Production is expected to be only slightly better in Bay, around 50-70 percent of average. Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and Emergency (IPC Phase 4) outcomes are likely among poor households in these areas until the Deyr harvest in January, with the greatest food insecurity expected after September, when households exhaust stocks.- In Northwestern Agropastoral livelihood zone, preliminary estimates indicate that August Gu harvests and November Karan long-cycle sorghum harvests will both be well below average. However, farmers are atypically planting short-cycle sorghum in July and the harvest of these crops in November will increase total production. Poor households will rely on the consumption of harvests and the sale of horticultural crops to meet their basic food needs throughout the outlook period. However, many will sell a high proportion of crops to repay debts and will remain Stressed (IPC Phase 2).- Local staple food prices remain below 2011 levels, but well above average. In Baidoa, the retail price of sorghum reached 10,300 SOS/kg in June, 95 percent above average and the highest June price since 2011. The retail price of maize in Qorioley in June was 10,750 SOS/kg, 50 percent above average and also the highest June price since 2011. Sustained high prices are attributed to below-average production in 2016 and traders withholding stocks from markets until August/September, when prices will be higher.- In most pastoral livelihood zones of Middle and Lower Juba, rainfall in mid-June and July improved pasture and water resources, which supported livestock body improvements. Despite the influx of livestock from Gedo, Bay, and Lower Shabelle, average pasture conditions are expected to sustain normal migration patterns throughout the July-September Xagaa season. Poor pastoralists from these regions will have increased access to milk and saleable livestock, and Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes are expected throughout the outlook period.- According to the Food Security Cluster (FSC), humanitarian organizations will distribute large-scale emergency assistance through December, targeting 1 million beneficiaries in August and 400,000-600,000 a month from September to December. This is below current levels of 2.5 million beneficiaries a month, though not all distribution plans were submitted to the FSC as of mid-July and actual targets may be higher.

During the same period, some very poor will already be facing food consumption gaps. Consumption of wild foods will be intensified. Incomes will slowly deteriorate after the rice transplanting and coffee weeding; labor opportunities will decrease and by May very poor households will have limited incomes. Very poor households will employ coping strategies like intensifying basketry or relying on borrowing food/remittances between March and May. Thus, people will likely not easily meet their food needs and will likely face Crisis (IPC Phase 3) between April and May 2018. From June onwards, very poor and poor households will begin to face fewer food consumption gaps with the coming harvests. Low staple prices and more income from rice, coffee and cassava harvests and cassava planting in August will result in better purchasing power, thereby tightening the food consumption gap. The coffee harvest expected in June will likely be near normal due to favorable rainfall that in turn will provide near normal incomes for households. Therefore, most households in this livelihood zone will experience Stressed (IPC Phase 2) food security outcomes again between June and September 2018.",3

36314,"CHALLENGE ACCESSING INFORMATION Risks, vulnerability and occurrence8 VERY LIMITED ACCESS TO INFORMATION ON AVAILABLE HUMANITARIAN SERVICES: only three groups (two female and one male group in Unchiprang) out of 23 FGDs knew about the existence of women’s safe spaces and PSS – some groups living less than 300 meters from such services in Kutupalong MS North and South. As for medical treatment, 10 groups out of 23 knew where medical facilities are, citing MSF eight times out of 10 (Unchiprang and zone TT). Information on medical centres and safe spaces for women is communicated through door-to-door visits and megaphone announcements, which participants in FGDs and key informants reported as good practice. The majority of FGDs and all key informants reported difficulties in getting information in the camp and women, the elderly, disabled and child-headed household being particularly vulnerable to that risk. When asked about potential solutions to support Rohingya refugees in identifying specific humanitarian services, female FGD mentioned potentially using pictures or logos of women on woman’s safe spaces, doctors on medical facilities and children on child friendly spaces. RUMOuR CONTROL AND RELIABILITY OF INFORMATION: fear of elephants stomping into settlements was mentioned by each of the FGD groups, but none of the participants knew where and when this had previously happened and therefore if this was a legitimate fear or not. Oxfam teams asked 10 of these FGD groups about rumour control and mechanisms in place to verify information, yet none of the groups knew how to verify information, since it is apparent that in large part they rely on rumours. In general, the majority of women get information from men or through speakerphones. This puts women and individuals with reduced mobility at great risk of dependence to men. RISK OF GETTING LOST IN CAMPS: most of the female FGDs reported that even if they could uphold purdah, they would not move much in the camps as they fear getting lost and there is no information disseminated in camps to indicate locations. They would prefer to stay in their own block and they are worried about their children playing out of the shelter, since they think they might get lost or be kidnapped for sex or human trafficking. Male FGDs reported that female single-headed households tend to send their children to fetch firewood, water and to buy groceries at the markets. It is not clear if the disappearance of children is due to them losing their way and having to live elsewhere in the camps or child abduction. Women suggested that signs and colours in block streets would help their movement within the camp and reduce the risk of them getting lost.",9

Several sites within the displaced camps and communities do not have an adequate supply of drinking water, leaving some of the needs of the most vulnerable populations unmet. In addition, there is a lack of latrines, and those that are in place are in poor condition.  From the experience of other hepatitis E outbreaks in Africa, the outbreak in Diffa could last for several more months. The number of suspected cases may increase further with the arrival of the rainy season, usually from June to September.“Given the scarcity of water for the most vulnerable populations, the risk is that alternative water sources that can spread the outbreak will be used, such as the supply from streams and other natural water points formed by accumulated rain water. These collection points are considered as potential vectors of the disease,” explains Audace Ntezukobagira, emergency coordinator for MSF in Diffa.  “It is also important to take into account that these people do not have the material or financial means to stock up on wood or gas to boil the water in order to make it suitable for consumption.”",4

37169,"Simultaneous humanitarian crises had a major impact on children and families in Niger in December and throughout 2017. Niger faced epidemic outbreaks, including meningitis C, measles and hepatitis E virus (HEV), humanitarian consequences of insecurity in the South East and North West of the country, and the humanitarian consequences of forced return from Algeria and Libya, as well as acute malnutrition throughout the country. Direct attacks by Boko Haram continued in the Diffa region, with violence against local communities and school canteen looting. Threats of humanitarian staff kidnapping led to a restriction of humanitarian movements in the field. In 2017, OCHA reported a total of 141 civilians affected, 60 people kidnapped (43 children), 10 schools and 10 health centers attacked. Nevertheless, authorities and humanitarian community have already agreed on the need to scale up the analysis and planning for longer term, resilience-building interventions. In Tillabery and Tahoua regions the security measures in place since March 2017 continue to worsen the structural vulnerabilities of the communities, and the expansion of military presence increases the risk of major displacements, and even though it has not yet the case, the humanitarian community keeps a contingency plan updated and is ready to be activated should the intervention threshold be exceeded. In terms of outbreaks, in December 3,506 cases of meningitis were reported in 2 health districts with 232 deaths. The Ministry organized a partial vaccination response with the pre-positioned but insufficient vaccines. The vaccination reached 38,525 people aged 2 to 29 years. By mid-February the vaccination will be completed with the new vaccines procured by the Ministry with UNICEF support for the submission of the request to ICG. As for hepatitis E, 2,145 cases (39 deaths) have been registered in 2018 with a continue decrease since July, and only 25 cases in December. Finally, measles has not been registered in December but UNICEF supported the Regional Health Department for the organization of supplementary immunization activities against measles to reach over 52,592 in departments affected by the humanitarian crisis and with low vaccination coverage. Agadez region continued to receive migration flows of people in transit either towards or from Algeria and Libya. In December, 23 unaccompanied children, forced returnees from Algeria, have been supported including 16-year old girl, mother of two children aged 7 months and 3 years. The assistance included psychosocial support, food, health check-ups, facilitation of communication with families, NFI kits and support for transport to rejoin their families accompanied by social workers. Since the beginning of the year UNICEF, in collaboration with IOM and the regional decentralized technical services, has supported 76 children among forcibly returned migrants from Algeria. Following the decision of the Government of Niger to accept the transit of a certain number of migrant (asylum seekers), including children, coming back from detention in Libya, who suffered most horrible acts of torture, UNHCR is working on durable solution for their possible resettlement in Europe or North America and for the granting of refugee status. UNHCR approached UNICEF to support up to 70 children in alternative care centers originally set up for other categories of vulnerable children. In collaboration with UNHCR and COOPI, in December UNICEF supported 67 boys (54 from Eritrea and 13 from Somalia) and 5 girls in three alternative care centers. They received medical assistance, food, psychosocial support as well as recreational activities. UNHCR was working for a durable solution for 217 adults and 105 children, however the process for children is complex.

This is likely to lead to higher income from livestock sales, particularly of goats.

These improvements will be less significant and short-lived in parts of Garissa, Tana River, Wajir, Mandera, and Isiolo where rainfall and rangeland resource regeneration were below average. As a result, household purchasing power is likely to be constrained by low incomes in these areas. Improvements in wage-earning opportunities like herding, are expected to improve but remain below average, and this also applies to conception rates and calving, lambing, and kidding levels in eastern areas of the country. Through mid-April 2018, milk production is expected to largely remain below average, and with households mostly depending on markets for food access , additional income sources, such as charcoal sales and remittances, will be relied upon to meet minimum food needs. The March – May long rains, though forecasted to be below average in parts of the northeast, are likely to begin in mid-March, bringing slight improvements in forage and water resources. While the resultant impacts are likely to remain below average, livestock body conditions and milk production will still increase. In the northwest pastoral areas, livestock body conditions and production are expected to increase from mid-March through April, improving milk production and livestock-related wage-earning opportunities to average to above-average levels. A large number of households will experience improvements, even if the levels for livestock productivity and sales remain below average. The majority of poor households in pastoral areas are expected to be able to meet their minimum food needs and be in Stressed (IPC Phase 2).

In previous rounds of monitoring, a substantial difference in food insecurity levels were observed between more urban IDPs (in Geneina town: Ardamata, El Riad, Kirinding 1) and more rural IDPs (in Mornie, Habila and Fur Buranga).

Household food consumption among protracted IDPs in West Darfur remained similar compared to the same time last year (May 2016). West and Central Darfur were particularly affected by increased transportation costs due to its long distance from Khartoum. Weak economic access to food was an important factor behind the food security deterioration, driven by high commodity prices and an increase in transportation costs and taxes. In addition, below average cereal production across West Darfur (confirmed in the 2017 state level post harvest assessment) affected the prices of the locally produced foods in the local food basket.

Among the worst-hit crops are paddy (summer rice), jute (vegetable fibre), dhaincha (multipurpose legume) and vegetables, with around 611,170 hectares of standing crops in 32 districts4 have suffered damages. The damage to agriculture will likely have an impact on the availability and price of food at the local markets as well as the demand for labour over the next months. Lesser work opportunities will reduce the purchasing power of vulnerable households, which will in turn result in a prolonged lean season and negatively affect food security and nutrition status. Another concern linked to agriculture is replanting the Aman crop, especially because seedbeds have been damaged. In addition, the flood situation is making it difficult for farmers to cultivate land as most embankments have been washed away. The floods have also affected availability of fodder for livestock, such as cattle, and reduced safe and secure places for the livestock, increasing the likelihood of cattle mortality. If the situation persists, the affected people are likely to resort to negative coping means such as taking loans or selling their poultry and livestock to obtain money for survival – a situation which leaves them economically vulnerable. Already, many farmers – who traditionally  rear cows and goats to sell during the Eid Ul Adha festival – fear that they may not be able to sell their livestock as expected and have resorted to immediate disposing them off at a lower market value.

Children especially are developing skin problems and rashes due to lack of hygiene and after playing in sewage water around burst pipes.” Unexploded ordnance and booby-traps have killed and wounded returnees.

33290,"A recent case control study conducted by the Somali Region Health Bureau, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and WHO in Jigjiga Town, the region’s capital, found most people in the region relied on information from neighbours and community leaders about AWD much more than radio or television. Knowing with whom and how to share key messages about AWD was essential to curbing the outbreak.  Additionally, the clear and elaborate administrative system in Somali Region, and throughout Ethiopia, is suitable for implementing effective community engagement.The main reason for low compliance with the WASH messages was shortage of water, particularly in arid rural areas, where people must choose between using their meagre water supply for drinking, food preparation or for sanitary purposes. In Somali Region, as in other places undergoing severe drought, shortage of safe water remains an important factor in AWD prevention and control.  There are knowledge gaps that require direct community engagement regarding the safety of water treatment chemicals, poor eating behaviors and sanitation practices. Some people live in “hard-to-reach” areas, requiring extra effort and different targeting strategies to reach them with AWD messages.  Overall community engagement using individual counselling, house-to-house mobilization, community meetings and use of religious institutions are proving invaluable in mobilizing communities for AWD action. Most importantly, community leaders in the region now appreciate that community engagement is their responsibility and that it has to continue even after AWD comes to an end.  For community engagement activities to bring about lasting change, they need to be complemented with other interventions including the provision of safe water, adequate supply of water treatment tablets and construction of latrines. This requires a multi-sectoral response and coordination between various stakeholders in the health and water management arenas.",4

17353,"In March 2018, the market supply of staple cereals is satisfactory except in pastoral zones of the North. Food availability for rural households is currently improved through the presence of garden produce (lettuce, cabbage, squash, potatoes, etc.) and the start of the operation '' vente de céréales à prix modéré ''. Currently, the average price of millet is above 200 FCFA / kg on almost in all regional capitals. Given these high price levels, access to cereals for poor households is seriously affcted. In the projected situation (June to September 2018), price levels could reach at least 260 FCFA / kg for millet on almost all markets monitored. (Source: Albichir No102 Mars 2018) Analysis of current cross border millet prices shows that price differences are relatively favorable to the import of millet and maize from Malanville in Benin and Illela in Nigeria. Terms of trade for goat versus millet remained almost constant during this month in most livestock markets. For instance, on the market of Abalak / Tahoua which is a pastoral livelhood area, the sale of a goat only allows the breeder to acquire only 35 kg of millet against 36 kg February 2018. This situation could be explained by a stable price of goat and millet on this market. The terms of trade are drastically down from the five-year average which allowed to acquire up to 80 kg of millet. The terms of trade (onion/millet) on the Agadez market indicate a 17% decrease in opportunities for access to onion farmers' cereals. In March 2018, a bag of 100 kilograms of onion trades for 97 kg of millet against 117 kg in February 2018 and 120 kg for the five year average. One could expect an increase in the prices of the main agricultural products, because of the upcoming start of Ramadan, when cereal demand is on the rise. However, this increase could be mitigated by the continuation of the operation '' vente de céré- ales à prix modéré ''. As an example, in Téra, 80 000 tonnes of cereals will be made available to 150 000 households from February to September. (Source: Albichir No102 Mars 2018)",3

Telafar had almost completely emptied out of people when the government of Iraq re-established control in August 2017 and has since then seen increasing returns (approximately 60,000-80,000 residents returned). Data on Telafar was collected between 28 March and 1 April 2018 through 24 remote interviews with returnees, residents who remain in displacement and individuals with sectoral knowledge and expertise.  The assessment found that the main reason driving residents to return to Telafar is perceived improved security, but many others are not returning because of damaged, destroyed or stolen property, a lack of livelihoods opportunities and children attending school in the area of displacement. The city itself has reportedly been largely cleared of explosive hazards, however some surrounding villages and agricultural lands are still not safe. As a result, agricultural lands are not being re-cultivated.  Basic services within Telafar are available, but they are running at reduced capacity due to shortages in staff and equipment. According to interviewees, half of the neighborhoods in the city are provided with water through a piped system, whilst the other half rely on water tanks that are filled periodically. For education and healthcare, facilities have reopened but with a limited amount of trained personnel. Lastly, there is a functioning court and an office for renewal of legal documentation, yet, there are long delays with legal processes and obtaining paperwork.",5

The violence has continued in subsequent days. Dozens of alleged gang members have reportedly descended on Rocinha at the behest of Antonio Francisco Bonfim Lopes, alias 'Nem,' who led the Amigos dos Amigos gang in Rocinha before he was arrested in 2011. Nem has reportedly maintained control over drug trafficking operations in Rocinha from federal prison since his arrest. The impetus for the recent violence has been linked to a feud between Nem and his former bodyguard Rogério Avelino da Silva, alias 'Rogério 157.' Rogério 157 has reportedly broken from the ranks of Nem's Amigos dos Amigos gang and joined forces with the Red Command (Comando Vermelho) in an apparent attempt to assert greater control over the local drug trade. The ongoing battle -- which according to O Globo has featured grenades, hours-long gun battles and a bus being set on fire -- has severely impacted normal life for Rocinha's residents.

The continuous restrictions on freedom of movement retain their negative repercussions also on some health aspects, particularly in Areesha site. Available ambulances seem to be able to transport only urgent cases to receive treatments in the Hassakeh hospital and IDPs reportedly bear the costs of the transport back to the IDP site. In addition, limitation in the availability of specialized treatment in the sites lowers the quality of the assistance. NES protection partners also highlighted the impact of restrictions on freedom of movement on IDPs’ ability to register vital events outside of IDP sites.

14342,"Earlier in the year, the “karan” harvest, gathered in November 2017 in northern regions and the major “gu” harvest, harvested in July in central and southern regions, also had abelow-average performance as inadequate amounts and erratic distribution of seasonal rains negatively impacted yields. Aggregate 2017 cereal production is estimated at 174 000 tonnes, about 26 percent below the average of the previous five years. Land preparation for the planting of 2018 “gu” season crops is underway in central and southern regions and seasonal rains are expected to start soon in March. Below-average precipitations are forecast in most central and inland regions, while average to above-average rainfall amounts are expected over southern and northern coastal areas. Heavy rains in November 2017 supported a partial recovery of rangeland and livestock conditions In pastoral areas, where rangeland and livestock conditions were severely affected by consecutive poor rainy seasons since mid2016, heavy rains in November 2017 supported some pasture regeneration, improving livestock body conditions in most pastoral areas, except in some northern parts, including Awdal and Woqooyi Galbeed regions, were drought conditions persisted. Despite the general improvement in livestock body conditions, animal reproduction and availability of livestock products remain generally low, as more than one year of drought resulted in a sharp reduction of herd sizes. Due to distress sales and high animal mortality rates, pastoralists have lost between 25 and 75 percent of their herds in 2017. In addition, improvements in rangeland conditions have been limited, as the rains did not continue into December and the “jilaal” January-March dry season had an early start. Access to food improving in recent months but still constrained for most households Prices of locally produced maize and sorghum declined by 20- 40 percent in the second semester of 2017 in most monitored markets as “gu” crops and sustained food assistance operations increased supplies. Prices increased in January 2018 in some markets, including the capital, Mogadishu, subsequently levelling off or beginning to decline in February as newly harvested “deyr” crops increased supplies. Prices of coarse grains in February were 15-40 percent below the high levels a year earlier, when drought conditions seriously affected crop production, but still up to 55 percent above the normal levels of 24 months earlier. Prices of livestock increased in recent months due to lower supplies resulting from severe livestock losses and currently, they are at high levels in most monitored markets. In Galkayo, one of the main livestock markets in the Horn of Africa, located in the Mudug Region, prices of goats and camels doubled between July 2017 and February 2018. Prices of milk are also generally high due to reduced supplies. In Galkayo, February prices of camel milk were about 35 percent above their year-earlier levels. As a result of increasing livestock prices and declining cereal prices, terms of trade for pastoralists significantly improved over the last 12 months. In Mogadishu, the equivalent in maize of one medium-size goat was 213 kg in February, more than double compared to one year earlier. However, these potential food access gains are unlikely to be translated in to solid food security  GIEWS global information and early warning system on food and agriculture improvements, as herders are engaged in repopulating their herds, have very few animals to sell and incomes from this livelihood activity is reported to be very limited. Food security improved since early 2018, but 2.7 million people still require assistance Since early 2018, the food security situation improved and the risk of famine declined due to the delivery of large-scale humanitarian assistance and the availability of newly harvested “deyr” crops. According to the latest multi-agency assessment, about 2.7 million people, more than one-fifth of the total population, are currently estimated to be severely food insecure (IPC Phases 3: “Crisis” and 4: “Emergency”), over 15 percent less than the estimated caseload in late 2017. However, the current caseload is still almost three times the estimate of mid2016, reflecting the dramatic impact on the local livelihoods of consecutive poor rainy seasons. The areas of major concern are central regions of Bay, Hiraan, Mudug and Galgadud and northern regions of Sanag and Sool, where 30-45 percent of the population is severely food insecure. Drought-related displacements declined significantly in the second semester of 2017, when 190 000 people were displaced compared to 649 000 during the first semester. However, it is reported that only 44 000 individuals have returned to their places of origin between July and December 2017 and the displaced caseload is currently estimated at high 2.7 million. Despite access constraints due to insecurity, humanitarian assistance has been substantially scaled up in the second semester of 2017, with the monthly number of assisted beneficiaries increasing from half a million individuals in January to 2.2 million in October-December 2017, mitigating the overall food insecurity and averting IPC Phase 5: “Famine” in the worst affected areas. In addition to emergency life-saving assistance, a timely and effective support to the agricultural sector is required to mitigate the extent of the impact of the prolonged drought on pastoralist and agro-pastoralist livelihoods.

The battle for the people of Yemen is two-fold: they fight for their lives not only against armed conflict but against poor health conditions. Noncommunicable diseases, malnutrition, and preventable diseases kill more people than bullets or bombs.    Noncommunicable diseases represent 39% of the main causes of death and treatment for diseases such as cancer, diabetes and hypertension is available in only 20% of health facilities across Yemen.   Cancer patients in Yemen struggled even prior to the conflict, unable to afford the costly treatment. Only 10 000 patients received some form of cancer treatment in 2017. However, the percentage of full treatment out of these 10 000 patients, increased from 30% to 60% of full treatments. Still, the needs are severe and WHO plans to deliver another shipment of anti-cancer drugs within the first half of 2018.  ",4

Markets tended to close altogether during times of heavy conflict, and residents often found it difficult to physically reach them, due sometimes to road damage and blockages and sometimes to a lack of transport or petrol to get there.KIs reported widespread shortages of fresh vegetables, fruits, milk and many types of meat. Flour and tomato paste were also subject to localised shortages, though these were least frequent in mahallas with functional markets.

12571,"Risks, vulnerability and occurrence RESTRICTED ACCESS TO WASH FACILITIES BY DAY: to maintain the upholding of purdah and due to lack of gender disaggregated WASH facilities, the majority of women do not access latrines, bathing facilities and waterpoints during the day. All female and male FGDs reported that women are ashamed to be seen by men who are not their relatives and therefore wait until night-time to go out. In addition to having a direct impact on the risk of SGBV and accidents when accessing WASH facilities by night female FGD participants reported that this situation greatly impacts their hygiene, health and nutrition as women. In particular, women are restricting their daily food and water intake to avoid having to use latrines as often. INCREASE OF Gender Based Violence WITHIN THE HOUSEHOLD: several women in each female FGD reported that the lack of burkas is creating tension in their households. Wives either have to break purdah to fetch water to cook or respect purdah and stay in, however both choices expose them to the risk of domestic violence from their husbands. One male FGD confirmed this situation, explaining to Oxfam teams “women cannot provide tea and men have to punish them because they do not accomplish their household chores”. RESTRICTED ACCESS TO HUMANITARIAN SERVICES (e.g. PSS AND MEDICAL SERVICES): Key informants report PSS (90%) and medical treatment for survivors of sexual violence (85%) as the most important needs for affected populations6 . Those services are available in the camps however, in the FGD performed in Unchiprang camp respondents stated that women would not access those services unless it was an extreme emergency. Upholding of purdah is prioritized over accessing humanitarian services available in the camps. Oxfam teams furthermore witnessed high levels of trauma among FGD participants. Multiple female participants were visibly distressed, constantly mentioning the horrendous events they witnessed in their last days in Myanmar no matter what subject was discussed. It should be noted that both male and female FGDs stated they want one-on-one PSS, with men mentioning that they would like a male safe space where they could talk about their fear and anger. SAFETY ACCESSING LOCAL MARKETS: this risk is specific to female single-headed households as food provision is part of the husband’s responsibility in Rohingya culture. In a camp environment women do not feel safe accessing local markets as they have to break purdah, be visible to men and therefore face greater risks of sexual harassment and assault.",9

Very few traders (11%) interviewed in markets are from the recent (August 2017) influx and these are exclusively spontaneous, unofficial stalls. Most local businesses are being run by host communities or recognized Rohingya refugees (pre 2007).Focus groups overwhelmingly identified agriculture as the most importance income source for men and boys prior to the crisis, yet no respondents cited current access to land of agricultural inputs to continue this activity.Discussions revealed that women and girls mostly used to engage in rearing poultry and tailoring in Myanmar, but were now almost entirely excluded from income generating activities. In fact, less than half of groups were even willing to provide answers to this question. Whereas every focus group cited tailoring as one of women and girls’ top three sources of income pre-crisis, there were no reports that women are engaging in this activity now. Sewing machines, thread and needles were repeatedly cited as inputs which could help women earn income now in displacement. However, almost all income sources cited as available to women and girls in displacement required no activity and were essentially gifted rather than ‘earned’, in comparison to men who were able to engage in some petty trade and casual labour.

26518," At first, UNHCR was in charge of the health and protection of Syrian refugees. In May 2013, due to the high costs of healthcare in Lebanon and reduction of international funding, UNHCR had to increase out of pocket payment for refugees from 15 to 25 %.UNHCR has adopted a public health approach which prioritizes affordable and accessible basic primary health and emergency care, over costlier and complex treatments and hospital care, with the aim of ensuring coverage for the greatest number of refugees in Lebanon. Syrian refugees in Lebanon have access to primary health care across Lebanon, which is largely provided by UNHCR’s non-governmental organisations (NGO) partners, in addition to the state provision maintained by the Ministry of Social Affairs. Those refugees registered with UNHCR and between the ages of five and 60 can get access to health care in the centres managed by NGOs for a fee of LP 3,000 to LP 5,000 per consultation (approximately US$2 to US$3). Individuals also have to pay for x-rays and other diagnostic tests, which are required for referral to hospital for further treatment or medicines, where these are needed. For those deemed vulnerable, 85 % of diagnostic costs are covered by UNHCR and 100 % of the cost of medicines under a programme provided for by a Lebanese charitable organization. This includes those under five years and over 60 years of age, disabled people, pregnant women and nursing mothers. Refugees who require other kinds of care, such as hospital care (secondary and tertiary care), must be referred by a primary health care centre that works with the UNHCR system, with the exception of a life-threatening emergency where this is not possible. For those that meet UNHCR’s criteria for hospital care, 75 % of the treatment costs are covered, with the remaining 25 % - as well as the cost of medicines - to be covered by the individual, unless they meet UNHCR’s vulnerability criteria or are victims of torture or sexual or gender-based violence, in which case 100 % of costs are covered [10].

Moreover, the prevalence and frequency of practicing other negative coping mechanisms have declined especially for skipping days without eating and sleeping hungry. The situation however remains precarious due to the increasing influx of returnees and the limited available livelihood options. ? Market functionality was identified to be weak in Deir-ez-Zor city due to traders’ lack of capital and consumers’ low cash liquidity which resulted in limited food stock in the market. Key wholesalers reported that most of the warehouses in Deir-ez-Zor are empty as traders cannot afford to buy more than their daily sales levels. ? Despite the relative improvement in food accessibility, the daily diet for the majority of the population in Deirez-Zor city, is limited. A typical diet is largely based on starch foods and pulses while financial access to nutritious and fresh food items was identified to be poor, likely resulting in the many cases of night blindness among children, a condition exacerbated by deficiency in vitamin A. ?

The timing of the price decrease is atypical as five year trends show that maize prices normally start registering modest decreases from April onwards. The main drivers of the early price decline include the presence of humanitarian assistance up to March, which reached almost half of the rural population.

Additionally, accompanying people with disabilities to the immunisation points would be highly appreciated. • Greater visibility of the Red Cross Red Crescent contribution should be ensured in future through the mass media in order to strengthen the image of RCST as a humanitarian organisation; • Regular contacts both official or unofficial should be maintained with government bodies in the field; • Regular contacts should be maintained with organisations/government bodies/private sector where RCST volunteers are employed in order to speed up mobilisation in case of an emergency; • Visibility of RCST should be given more attention when implementing any activities. Conclusions: • Cooperation needs to be improved with health sector, including with REACT Health Sector; government bodies, international organisations and NGOs – based on relevant cooperation agreements, and a participatory approach involving provincial, district-level and local authorities/community leaders. • Regular trainings as well as information sessions need to be conducted for National Society branch staff and volunteers, using good practices and lessons learned in the field of national immunisation campaigns and activities, including dissemination of information materials to enhance Red Cross Red Crescent visibility.

6372," Despite repeated ceasefire arrangements, the security situation in eastern Ukraine remained volatile, with daily hostilities and ceasefire violations continuing in multiple locations along the ‘contact line’. In late January, heavy fighting intensified in Avdiivka – Yasynuvata – Donetsk area and spilled into February. The sudden spike of hostilities triggered not only loss of lives, but also concerns around protection of civilians and the concurrent, sustained damages of critical civilian infrastructure. According to OHCHR, some 182 civilian casualties were reported over the first quarter of 2017, compared to 88 during the same period last year, representing an increase of 52 per cent.  The sudden uptick of hostilities caused widespread damage to housing and other critical civilian infrastructures, particularly electricity and water supply systems, on which millions of people on both side of the ‘contact line’ were dependent. Access to water and heating for some 2.9 million people was at risk due to the inter-dependent infrastructure between Government-Controlled and Non-Government Controlled Areas (GCA and NGCA) during the coldest months of the year when the temperature dropped as low as -17C. Repair teams continued to put their lives at risk, as fragile ceasefires were often broken while restored power lines were repeatedly damaged, nullifying the efforts to ensure the operation of critical infrastructure.",10

14703,"The ongoing food security emergency in western Yemen is likely to continue to drive very high assistance needs through at least January 2018. IDP populations and poor households in conflict zones will likely continue to face the most severe food security outcomes.

Governorates where humanitarian assistance is playing a key role in preventing worse food security outcomes (including Abyan, Aden, Ad Dali, Al Bayda, Hajjah, Saadah, Shabwah and Ta’izz) will likely deteriorate into Emergency (IPC Phase 4) in the absence of continued assistance between November 2017 and January 2018.

32988,"As an emergency clinic was the single medical facility reported as functioning during the assessment period, residents had extremely limited access to medical services. Following the rapid escalation of aerial bombardment, the already-stretched medical facilities could not cope with the additional demand for medical care. According to reports, the only functioning general hospital in Duma, providing services to about 100,000 residents in the region6 , was damaged during the air strikes on Duma, and as such, could only operate as an emergency care point from then on. WHO has confirmed that two health facilities were affected by the attacks during the assessment period.6 • While residents had previously travelled to facilities in neighbouring communities, CRs reported that the protection risks involved with travel meant that these facilities were no longer accessible. AVAILABILITY OF MEDICAL PERSONNEL AND SERVICES • While medical facilities were limited, there were reportedly several types of professionally trained medical personnel available in the community. These included surgeons, doctors, nurses, midwives, and anaesthesiologists. • As such, residents had some access to emergency care, only providing first aid and surgery if the medical equipment was available. However, diabetes care, mental healthcare, and psychosocial support were not available to residents. AVAILABILITY OF MEDICAL ITEMS • Despite the availability of some professionally trained medical personnel in Duma, the insufficiency of medical facilities and limited access to necessary medical supplies has led to a major medical crisis in Eastern Ghouta. Some medical supplies have systematically not been permitted entry and have reportedly been taken out of commercial and humanitarian deliveries.13 • In Duma, availability of medical items was reportedly limited: blood transfusion bags and some types of surgical scissors were sometimes available, while antibiotics were rarely available. 5 Only expired anaesthetics were available to residents, with CRs reporting that only certain types of expired anaesthetics were utilised as it was widely known that they do not have side effects. Other medical items, including blood stores, clean bandages, and clean syringes were not available at all. Coping Strategies: • Given the paucity of medical care, residents and medical personnel employed several strategies to cope with a lack of access to adequate medical care and supplies. • Residents of Duma reportedly resorted to treating themselves at home, asking untrained civilians for medical care, and using non-medical items for treatment. Meanwhile, medical personnel were forced to deny medical care to less serious cases to conserve resources, share medical resources, and recycle medical items. Some medical personnel also treated patients in non-medical and unsterile facilities. Medical personnel were unable to refer patients to other facilities outside of the community given the severe protection risks associated with movement. Barriers to Healthcare: • The deteriorated security situation was the main barrier to accessing healthcare reported in Duma; residents were sometimes unable to access medical services, even within the community, due to facilities being damaged or destroyed as well as their inability to leave underground shelters. Upon visiting the facility, residents would face limited medical services available and a lack of medical equipment or supplies. Despite medical professionals being present, they were unable to cope with the demand for medical care. • While there was some (limited) medical infrastructure and medical personnel, high caseloads restricted access to the most severe of cases only, and even then reportedly not all severe cases would receive medical care. Following the alleged use of weaponised chemical substances on 7 April, over 1,000 people were reported to require medical care for respiratory illnesses.5 The already stretched medical services were reportedly overrun with patients. • The partial destruction of the only general hospital, as well as mass casualties and injuries in the assessment period, has placed further strain on the medical infrastructure of Duma.",4

Food Consumption: In the current period, 13 out of the 16 states and FCT are in the minimal phase of food insecurity situation; 3 states are under stress while 1 is in crisis.Evolution of livelihoods: Livelihood activities in all the states are favourable except in conflict areas.Nutrition: Adamawa, Borno and Yobe States are facing nutritional challenges.The results of this analysis that identified the food and nutrition insecure areas within sixteen northern states of Nigeria and the FCT were arrived at after analyzing the food and nutrition security outcome indicators and their relevant contributing factors. The Result of the CH analysis indicates that a proportion of the population have drifted from the higher CH phases (4 to 5) of food insecurity to lower phases (1 to 3). This is attributable mainly to an improvement of the security situation, livelihood activities and scaling up of humanitarian assistance from the Government and Partners. In the current period (Oct–Dec 2017), food consumption classification indicated minimal and acceptable situations in areas less affected by the insurgency mainly in Bauchi, Benue, Gombe, Jigawa, Plateau, FCT, Niger, Kebbi, Katsina, Kaduna, Taraba, Zamfara and Sokoto States; stress situations in Kano, Yobe and Adamawa States and crisis in Borno state.

Livelihood activities in all the states except in parts of Plateau, Taraba, Benue, Zamfara, Kaduna, Adamawa, Borno and Yobe States are favourable due to increased income from cash crops sales from normal harvest in these states.

During 2018, FEWS NET expects severe levels of food insecurity to persist in drought-affected areas of Ethiopia, particularly in Somali, due to the cumulative effects of poor seasonal rainfall in 2016 and 2017, anticipated below-average rainfall through mid2018, and ongoing conflict-related displacement.

Household surveys, rapid field assessments, and the post-meher seasonal assessment indicate that severe levels of food insecurity and acute malnutrition persist among displaced and vulnerable populations in Somali. IDPs in the region are particularly affected due to livestock losses and protracted displacement.

Pastoralists in Mudug region have reportedly lost nearly 65 per cent of their livestock due to the severe drought conditions since November 2016.

However, the rains are getting off to an extremely slow start in pastoral areas, which are feeling the effects of a protracted lean season.

There were low cereal supplies on most markets in the month of June with the limited flow of imports from Nigeria due to continued restrictions and the higher prices on source markets in that country. Demand is rising in line with normal seasonal trends, fueled by needs for seeds for rainfed crops, for the Ramadan fast, and for the replenishment of the food stocks of returning transhumant pastoralists.

In the three most directly affected states of Adamawa, Borno and Yobe, 7.7 million people require humanitarian assistance, including 4.3 million children and 1.6 million internally displaced persons, more than half of whom are children. Ninety-two per cent of the internally displaced are located in the three north-eastern states.

An estimated 1.5 million people lack access to safe water (940,000 in Borno, 480,000 in Adamawa and 80,000 in Yobe). As a result, vulnerable children are becoming acutely malnourished after repeated bouts of diarrheal disease. Only half of the 755 health facilities in Borno State remain functional and nearly 1,400 schools have been damaged or destroyed. Many of these schools are unable to reopen for safety reasons. More than 1 million children in Nigeria are currently out of school.

35076,"Wholesale maize prices, were mostly stable in the second semester of 2016, surged by 20-40 percent between January and March 2017 in all monitored markets due to the upward pressure exerted by the drought-driven failure of the secondary 2016 “short-rains” harvest and by concerns over the performance of the 2017 main “long-rains” harvest, due to a delayed onset of seasonal rains. Prices of maize in March were up to 66 percent higher than 12 months earlier and at near-record to record levels, on account of a reduced 2016 cereal production coupled with reduced and highly priced imports from neighbouring Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania, where the supply situation is tight. In drought-affected southeastern marginal agricultural counties, mainly dependent on the “short-rains” season, sharper year-on-year price increases were recorded. In Tharaka Nithi, Meru, Kitui, Makueni and Embu counties, maize prices in February were up to more than twice their year-earlier levels. Prices of beans were also at high levels, up to 80 percent above their values in March last year. Prices of livestock declined in recent months to very low levels due to the severe drought in pastoral and agro-pastoral areas, as animal body conditions have substantially deteriorated and pastoralists were forced to reduce their herd sizes. In Marsabit, Garissa and Tana River counties, prices of goats in February were between 25 and 55 percent lower than a year earlier. As a result of declining livestock prices and increasing cereal prices, the terms of trade for pastoralists sharply deteriorated over the last 12 months. The equivalent in maize of a medium-sized goat in Garissa county declined by 60 percent on a yearly basis, from 71 kg in February 2016 to just 28 kg in February 2017. ",3

Prices are the double of last year because goods, particularly poor quality dried cassava from last year’s harvest in the district of Ambovombe, must travel farther to reach these markets.In a typical year in the south, households would still consume own-production of maize in May but this year they are mostly accessing cassava at markets, at higher than usual prices, as most poor households have already exhausted their own cassava stocks. Households also complement market purchases with cactus fruits or leaves.

37341,"Most Likely Food Security Outcomes During the postharvest period, most poor households throughout most of the country are consuming their own production across the country. Dry season harvests are also increasing access to food. Most households are engaged in normal incomeearning opportunities,such as dry season cultivation and harvests, land clearing activities, and petty trading. Others are engaged in casual labor and construction work to earn income. Coupled with normal livelihood strategies such as cash crop sales,livestock sales, and market food purchases, most poor households will face Minimal (IPC Phase 1) acute food insecurity outcomes through May 2018. As the lean season peaks, poor households outside the northeast impacted by communal conflict in the central states including Kaduna, Benue, Plateau, and Taraba; cattle rustling and dry spells – in Zamfara, Katsina, Jigawa, Bauchi and Kano States; flooding and farmer/pastoralist conflict in Benue and Taraba States have substantially impacted negatively on main harvest across the affected areas, leading to limited food production level. These households are yet to recover from the impacts of the floods and conflict and have limited own production from the main harvest. They will resort to markets earlier than usual, as food prices are elevated. Thus, they will only be able to meet basic food needs and will be Stressed (IPC Phase 2) until the main harvest in October 2018. However, a small proportion of these affected populations remain displaced and are unable to engage in their normal livelihood activities, have limited income earning opportunities and are reliant on atypical labor work. They are likely to consume less preferred foods during the lean season and will be unable to meet basic food needs, while others are facing wide food consumption gaps with high levels of acute malnutrition. Poor households in parts of Borno and Adamawa States who had poor or no main season harvests and have restricted access to markets, livelihoods activities, and assistance are facing large food consumption gaps with elevated levels of acute malnutrition, and will remain in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) acute food insecurity through at least May 2018. Humanitarian actors have scaled-up their response in Borno, Yobe, and Adamawa States, reaching about 2.1 million people with food assistance on average between March and December 2017. Livelihoods assistance has also been extensive, reaching 1.2 million people per month on average within the same period. Food assistance has been maintained through early 2018, reaching over 2.6 million people across the three worst-affected states. This is partly attributable to increased access to areas that were formerly difficult to access by the humanitarian actors, and liberation of more areas by the joint military operations. Thus, households in relatively accessible areas with improved humanitarian assistance are facing Crisis (IPC Phase 3), while others are almost entirely dependent on humanitarian assistance and are facing Crisis (IPC Phase 3!). However, in areas less affected by the Boko Haram conflict across the three northeastern states, many households are able to engage in below-average livelihood activities. Where markets are functioning, many are facing Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes through May 2018. With limited income-earning opportunities and likely unsustainable food assistance in areas worst affected by the insurgency, the seasonal increase in staple food prices during the lean season and restricted market and humanitarian access during the rainy season will lead most households that are partly or entirely dependent on humanitarian assistance to face Emergency (IPC Phase 4) acute food insecurity outcomes through at least September 2018. Areas where populations are affected by complete loss of livelihoods activities and who remain inaccessible to humanitarian actors are likely facing similar or worse food security outcomes relative to adjoining areas.",3

These temporary displacements have caused serious financial losses and psychological problems, particularly among the children.

Settlers are never asked to vacate their homes, temporarily or for good, to allow for military exercises.   The military does not confine itself to driving Palestinians from their homes and exploiting their environment. Despite insisting on training near communities and on their farmland, no effort is made to comb the areas afterwards to remove unexploded duds.

Under the new regulations passed in Law 10 in 2018, once a development zone has been designated, the authorities must publicly notify home and land owners, who have only 30 days to assemble the necessary paperwork and claim their property.With more than 11 million Syrians displaced, either within Syria or living as refugees in other countries, this is likely to be a near impossible feat for many of those affected. According to research by the Norwegian Refugee Council, barely one in five Syrian refugees have title deeds in their possession. Twenty-one percent said their documents had been destroyed.“If enacted, this law could be used to implement a breathtakingly efficient feat of social engineering. Thousands of Syrians – mostly those in pro-opposition areas or who have sought refuge abroad - risk losing their homes because their documents are lost or destroyed.

Conflict continues to affect civilians’ ability and strategies to cope with the drought, while the drought and humanitarian action influence conflict, political, and protection dynamics. To continue to achieve the greatest impact of life-saving interventions it remains essential to understand these dynamics and their impact on the situation of individuals, families, and populations. Incidents of GBV continue to be reported, predominantly in IDP sites. Forced evictions, often related to disputes over the amount of ‘rent’, continue unabated. So far (Jan-Aug) NRC has recorded more than 110,000 individuals as directly affected, primarily in Mogadishu, but instances continue to be reported in Baidoa (over 5,000 individuals affected). Forced recruitment remains a concern. Between January – August 1, 202 children have been affected.

Trapped behind a four-year regime siege, East Ghouta’s estimated 400,000 residents are facing major shortages of food and baby formula after the Syrian government tightened its encirclement of the rebel stronghold last spring. In March, an offensive by regime forces closed down underground smuggling tunnels that rebels had used to bring food, fuel and other goods into the pocket—a major blow to the opposition-held enclave’s food security. Then, three months ago, East Ghouta lost its last lifeline when the regime-run al-Wafideen checkpoint—used by war profiteers to sell food behind the siege—halted operations. There is a statistic from the Syria Relief Network [an umbrella organizing body for 60 Syrian NGOs] that 72 percent of East Ghouta children under five years of age need food support.

Furthermore, above-average temperatures prevailed, with an earlier than normal snowmelt process.   • Although several significant precipitation events during late spring helped alleviate dryness across the country, late rainfall was not sufficient to mitigate seasonal dryness in many parts of the country, which is most severe in the northwest but also significant across much of the north, northeast, southwest and central provinces. Field reports confirm that area planted for rainfed wheat is less than that of last year due to dry soil condition s and the use of extended areas for grazing, while a significant proportion of planted rainfed areas may have reduced yields due to dryness.   •   •   Snowmelt water availability has ended early in most basins, which is likely to adversely impact yields for some areas during the main season, and more broadly for second (dry) season irrigated production.   Forecasts indicate below-average to average precipitation while transitioning from spring to summer season. Along with cumulative precipitation deficits, the below-average forecast is reflective of a low frequency of storms entering the region, increasing the risk for extended periods of dryness that could impact agricultural production.

However, from week 31 (week ending 6 August 2017), there has been a dramatic increase in the incidence of dengue fever in the country, especially around the districts of Ouagadougou, the capital city. On 28 September 2017, the Ministry of Health formally declared the outbreak. During week 40 (week ending 8 October 2017), 525 suspected cases including two deaths (case fatality rate 0.4%) were reported. Of these, 329 cases were classified as probable. The majority of the new suspected cases were from Bogodogo (276) and Nogr-massom (115) districts, respectively.Between 1 January and 8 October 2017, a cumulative total of 2 298 (suspected, probable and confirmed) cases and nine deaths (case fatality rate 0.4%) were reported across the country.

Out of 205 samples referred to the national viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF) laboratory at the Center Muraz, 110 (54%) were positive on polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Further characterisation of 72 samples identified three serotypes of dengue virus (DENV): DENV-2 (80.6%), DENV-3 (16.7%) and DENV-1 (2.8%). Cases are currently reported in 12 of the 13 health zones in the country, with 77.8% of cases reported in the central region, particularly the city of Ouagadougou.This outbreak of dengue fever in Burkina Faso is occurring in the context of an improved but still limited dengue surveillance system, as many public health facilities do not have access to dengue fever RDTs. The weekly case incidence has been on the rise since the detection of the outbreak in week 31, and is likely underestimated due to under-reporting from private clinics and health centres in peripheral zones. The existence of breeding sites after the rainy season may favour the proliferation of mosquitoes such Aedes aegypti (the principal mosquito vector of dengue viruses).

27662,"Conflict, displacement, and economic decline are placing severe pressure on essential basic services and the institutions that provide them, pushing them towards total collapse. Humanitarian programmes in Yemen are predicated on an assumption of at least minimal functionality of state services in key sectors like health, water, education and social protection. However, growing evidence points to imminent institutional collapse across large swathes of the country. The Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation (MOPIC) in Sana’a reports that Central Bank foreign exchange reserves dropped from $4.7 billion in late 2014 to less than $1 billion in September 2016. The public budget deficit has nearly doubled in the last year, to about $1.8 billion. Salaries for health facility staff, teachers and other public sector workers go increasingly unpaid, leaving 1.25 million state employees and their 6.9 million dependents – or nearly 30 per cent of the population – without an income at a time of shortages and rising prices. Despite Government commitments to the contrary, relocation of the Central Bank to Aden had not resolved salary arrears as of late October. State-provided social services are rapidly collapsing while needs are surging. In August, the Ministry of Public Health and Population (MOPHP) in Sana’a announced it could no longer cover operational costs for health services. As of October 2016, only 45 per cent of health facilities were functional; this rate falls below 25 per cent  in five governorates, including Marib, Al Jawf and Al Dhale’e. Absenteeism among key staff – doctors, nutrition counsellors, teachers – is reportedly rising as employees seek alternatives to provide for their families. On top of pressure to compensate for a faltering commercial sector, humanitarian partners are fielding calls to fill gaps created by collapsing public institutions, which is beyond both their capacity and remit. It is essential for all stakeholders to stem this collapse, including through selective re-engagement of development programmes, which have been largely frozen since early 2015. ",5

The East Africa Cross-Border Trade bulletin has indicated that sorghum exports from Sudan to northern South Sudan are expected to increase through March but likely to be below the recent five year average, attributable to insecurity-related trade disruptions. The same report indicates that export of maize and dry beans from Uganda to South Sudan is expected to continue seasonally but volumes are expected to be below last year and four year average levels; the export parity prices are relatively high. The functionality of markets plays a key role in moving food commodities from local production or imports from source markets. Given the sporadic blockade of roads compounded by the unpredictability of the economic and political situation of the country, the flow of commodities is not likely to improve in the coming months. Furthermore, traders are less likely to aggregate and stockpile commodities in large quantities during such a volatile situation. Imports are also likely to be affected negatively by scarcity of hard currency, high transport costs and the prevailing insecurity across the country.",3

Talking to Pajhwok on Sunday (March 18), Helmand education director Daud Shah Safari termed it a great injustice with children to convert their schools into security posts.  He said the education system was struggling with other issues as well and the posts had multiplied their problems. He questioned how parents would send their children to schools where armed forces were stationed.  He said the school buildings had been divided between posts and classes.  “Not only in districts and insecure areas, police have established a check-point in a school in Safian area of Lashkargah, the provincial capital.  Daud Shah Safari said the military recently vacated and handed over to the education department the building of the District High School in Nad Ali district after using it for one and a half years.  During the army’s check-post establishment, most of the school’s documents and data had been lost and the building suffered damage as well, he said.  The education official said he might approach private construction companies for repairing the damaged building in Nad Ali district, for which a specific budget was needed.  Safari said some issues his department faced earlier had been resolved but still many problems remained such as the lack of monitoring of schools.  However, he said a monitoring team had been constituted and the group had started its investigation to unearth ‘imaginary’ schools.

Muhibullah, a student of the Nad Ali High School, said they attended classes a separate building until their school served as an army check-post.  He added now the Afghan National Army (ANA) soldiers had vacated the school but its building had damaged and was not suitable for study.  The student asked the government to reconstruct their school so they were able to continue their studies.  Mohammad Umar, a resident of Safian locality and student of Dosti High School, claimed their school building had been occupied by police where they had established a check-post.  “We are not happy with the situation and seeing people in uniform walk inside the school. Our school administration has many times complained in this regard but nobody paid attention.”  Helmand governor’s spokesman Omar Zwak said as the conflict expanded in Helamd during the past two years, many schools were either closed or shifted elsewhere. During this period, buildings of some schools were used as check-posts.  He added the issue had been discussed in meetings with military officials and check-posts from most of schools had been withdrawn.

31585," With the effects of climate change and extreme weather events disproportionately affecting people in the Pacific, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) with the support of the Marshall Islands government is providing emergency aid to some of the Marshall Islands remote atolls hit hardest by drought.  In February, Auguste Lameta and Francis Chopin from FAO together with Sepola Lafita the RMI national consultant, travelled to Wotje atoll to carry out interviews of householders to evaluate the impacts of the drought on household garden fruit and vegetable production. Wotje atoll is about 150 nautical miles north of Majuro and home to about 120 households. There is a flight from Majuro usually about once per week. Infrequent boat transport means supplies in households and the schools often running out, the islanders must take care of themselves. Most shortages can be met but occasionally, nature throws a curve ball and life can get tough for a long time. “Drought in the remote atolls can be devastating since it not only shrivels up the fruit and vegetables but scorches the ground and saps the spirit of gardeners”, said Francis Chopin, Senior Fisheries and Aquaculture Officer. “Salt spray, heat stress and poor soils add to the factors the islanders have to cope with”, he added.  “Our mission to Wotje atoll, one of five atolls to be visited in the coming months, was to interview householders and to listen to their opinions on the types of seeds, seedlings and training support needed to re-establish household gardens” said Auguste Lameta, FAO Programme Associate. She added, “we interviewed about 25% of the households across Wotje including the teachers at the Northern Islands High School (NIHS) and elementary school to get asnapshot of the issues and future needs”. Even on such a small atoll there are distinct differences in household garden production on ocean and lagoon sides.  The FAO project is focused on providing immediate relief to 70% of the households across five atolls (Wotje, Aur, Maloelap, Mejit and Namu) through the provision of seeds and seedlings. However, the interviews from Wotje indicate that provision of seeds alone is not sufficient to ensure the project outcomes. There is a need for soil enrichment, better watering practices, pest management to name but a few. In this regard, the presence of a high school that receives students from four of the atolls in our project can be a great help in implementing the project and working with the community on developing and implementing better gardening practices. “NIHS have an agriculture teaching course as part of the school curriculum and the school has expressed interest to deliver community based training to islanders as well as involving their students in new gardening approaches such as “key hole gardens”, said Lameta.",1

Prior to this, under former President Hosni Mubarak, Egypt was under a state of emergency for 31 years which ended in 2012, facilitating systematic violations and giving Egypt’s security forces the power to detain thousands of people for years in administrative detention without respecting procedural guarantees intended to ensure fair administration of justice. In 2013, the Constitutional Court struck down the provision allowing for administrative detention under the Emergency Law (law 162 of 1958).  Since the state of emergency was lifted, the Egyptian authorities have relied on the regular criminal justice system for long-term pre-trial detention and special terrorism chambers for mass trials that have led to the sentencing of hundreds to death or life imprisonment after unfair trials.

Internally displaced women and girls, as well as migrants, refugees and asylum-seekers, are acutely vulnerable to sexual violence. Daily threats to their safety, including sexual harassment, restrict women’s mobility and their ability to conduct livelihood tasks. There are concerns about possible linkages between migration, trafficking, and conflict-related sexual violence by armed groups, including violent extremist groups, operating in Yemen. However, such incidents are challenging to document as sexual violence in general is vastly underreported owing to shame, stigma and fear of retaliation, lack of service coverage, and the requirement that service providers refer cases to the police.

Persistent fuel shortages have continued since March 2018. In areas such as North Kordofan, North Darfur, and Gadarif, field reports suggest fuel shortages have driven shortages of water pumped from boreholes for livestock consumption and irrigation of off-season crops. High fuel prices could also drive increased production costs during the main agricultural season in the semi-mechanized rainfed and irrigated sectors.  Seasonal increases in demand and reductions in supply, combined with significant fuel shortages and increased transportation costs, are driving price increases for staple cereals across Sudan.

Unless solutions are found, it is a perpetual cycle of replacing sub-standard or no longer habitable temporary shelters.

The response to cholera can’t only be medical treatment, it is also necessary to work on development to provide adequate water and sanitation to the population. Until that happens, cholera will remain a real threat.”  Another cause of the rapid spread of the disease is its infiltration of densely populated cities.

The significant losses are particularly affecting rural farming and herding families, forcing people to migrate or to look for other sources of income. Vast areas of agricultural land with orchards or crops have been destroyed and farmers are facing shortages of agricultural inputs (seeds, fertilizers, fuel to power irrigation pumps, etc.) or are unable to afford them due to soaring prices. Annual crops were registered as the largest share of lost production (economic losses), followed by livestock. Conversely, the livestock subsector accounted for the highest proportion of damage, followed by perennial crops.

Emergency shelter, non-food items (ES/NFIs), food and access to water and sanitation services are the priority needs of these new IDPs, according to the joint inter-agency team’s preliminary findings. ES/NFIs: The new IDPs arrived with few personal belongings and are sheltering under trees. Water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH): There is one water pump in Jemeza village, which has been repaired by the inter-agency team, which also brought some WASH materials with them. However, due to the large number of displaced, the amount of water available is below SPHERE standards.  Health and nutrition: There is no health facility in Jemeza village and the nearest health facility where IDPs can access health and nutrition services is in Rokero town. The health facility is run by the State Ministry of Health (SMoH) with support from Catholic Relief Services (CRS) and World Relief (WR). Currently, half rations of the 800 cartons of plumpy nut (nutrition supplement) available in the facility is being distributed to children under five. Nutrition screening is also being undertaken.  Education: The estimated new IDP population includes about 1,150 school-age children, who are currently out of school due to lack of education facilities in the area.  Child protection: Three children were reported missing during interviews with the displaced community.

37887,"Even before the current crisis, women and girls in Yemen faced entrenched gender inequalities that limited access to services, livelihoods and other opportunities as a result of prevailing social norms. Conflict has in many cases exacerbated these limitations, and women and girls face a range of specific vulnerabilities. Female-headed households face additional challenges as they seek to provide for their families in a difficult environment, potentially relying on negative coping strategies that leave them susceptible to exploitation and abuse. Key informants across the country report that 10.3 per cent of IDP households are headed by females, including 2.6 per cent headed by minor females. Child marriage remains a serious issue, with 52 per cent of Yemeni girls marrying before age 18, and 14 per cent before age fifteen. Rates of child marriage are reportedly increasing as families seek dowry payments to cope with conflict-related hardship. An IDP assessment in Taizz revealed that 8 per cent of girls aged 12 to 17 are pregnant, indicating a prevalence of early marriage. Escalating conflict and displacement are also associated with greater risks and incidence of gender-based violence (GBV), including sexual abuse. Focus group discussions have shown that women report psychological distress due to violence, fear for family members, and fear of arrest or detention, while men report distress due to loss of livelihoods, restricted mobility, and being forced to perform “women-specific roles”. These kinds of stress among males can lead to increased levels of domestic violence, placing more women at risk. The GBV Information Management System (IMS) recorded 8,031 incidents between January and September 2016, 64 per cent of which were cases of emotional or psychological abuse (3,373 cases) or physical assault (1,767 cases).

In the Gaza Strip the land policy is more straightforward, but even so, 55% of plots are under 0.3 hectares. Thisreduces the efficiency of the land use, by leading to plots being too small for it to be worthwhile to use them, and to an individualized approach to management rather than a joint communal approach.20 In order to balance the size of the herd with the small plot of land available to them for grazing, herders have either sold their flocks altogether, or retained only a small flock. The limited access to public rangeland prevents the traditional pastoral economy from thriving.

The 27-page report, “‘I Have No Idea Why They Sent Us Back’: Jordanian Deportations and Expulsions of Syrian Refugees,” documents that during the first five months of 2017, Jordanian authorities deported about 400 registered Syrian refugees each month. In addition, approximately 300 registered refugees each month returned to Syria during that time under circumstances that appeared to be voluntary. Another estimated 500 refugees each month returned to Syria under circumstances that are unclear. Jordan has hosted more than 654,500 Syrian refugees since 2001. Human Rights Watch has repeatedly called for other countries to increase their assistance to Jordan and to resettle greater numbers of Syrian refugees living in Jordan.Collective expulsions and individual deportations of Syrian refugees spiked in mid-2016 and again in early 2017. The increased deportation rates followed armed attacks on Jordanian forces, including an attack in northeast Jordan in June 2016 that killed seven, and attacks around the southern city of Karak in December 2016 that killed 19. Jordanian authorities have provided no evidence that any deportees were involved in any of these attacks.

In much of the northeast, income-generating opportunities are extremely limited due to conflictrelated disruptions to normal livelihoods patterns. Large populations in accessible areas are highly dependent on humanitarian assistance for food access. Large areas of the northeast are expected to continue face Emergency (IPC Phase 4) outcomes, although some moderate improvements in food security outcomes for some are expected after harvests in October.   ? Despite some improvement in the security situation in areas near major towns in northeastern Nigeria, many areas remain inaccessible to humanitarian agencies. It is likely civilian populations remaining in these areas are experiencing similar or worse conditions to neighboring, accessible areas, and as such there is an ongoing risk of Famine (IPC Phase 5) in inaccessible areas of Borno State.  ? Humanitarian agencies have scaled-up their response to the food security situation in the northeast, reaching over two million people with food assistance in Borno, Adamawa, and Yobe States in June 2017. However, the response plan elaborated by the food security sector for 2017 was only 24 percent funded as of May 2017, and humanitarian agencies have already reduced operations in some LGAs. As many households in accessible areas of the northeast have very few income-generating opportunities and face very high food prices, they will remain highly dependent on humanitarian assistance throughout the outlook period.  ? The rainy season has started with near-normal timing and cumulative rainfall across most of Nigeria. Outside of the northeast, staple harvests that begin as late as October in northern areas are likely to be greater than last year, due to increased access to inputs as well as strong production incentives for farmers due to very high staple food prices.",3

2984,"As a result of seasonal dry weather, low water tables have heightened competing demands for water among humans and animals, and the scarce water sources available are being over-used. In Eastern Equatoria the regional drought is causing additional strain, with low food and water availability causing population displacements. While populations would traditionally move towards northern Kenya and Ethiopia, access to these routes are currently limited due to insecurity along the Ethiopian border and drought affecting the Turkana area of Kenya. With limited options for accessing water and food, populations are now under severe strain. The most significantly affected county is Kapoeta, where at least two adults, both women, were reported to have died from hunger as they were travelling towards Kenya in search of food. The dry season in South Sudan typically lasts from November until March, though may extend as far as until May. A prolonged dry season will have devastating consequences on the already limited water and food security in the country, and will likely result in drought conditions in several states. Extremely dry weather and drought is likely to result in increased inter-communal conflict as populations migrate in search water. This is aniticipated to be a particular issue in Jonglei state, which is home to a significan cattle-keeping community. Disputes traditionally arise as a result of competition for water and pasture for livestock.The current harsh dry weather experienced in South Sudan has yet to reach drought levels, but is considered a particularly severe dry season. One exception is in Kapoeta, Eastern Equatoria, where the regional drought is having severe consequences for people and livelihoods. The drought being experienced in Kapoeta has resulted in migration of the communities with their livestock in search of water and pasture towards the borders to Uganda, Ethiopia and Kenya.This is impacting negatively on the water sources as livestock and humans compete for the limited facilities that are functional.",11

Over 376 stool samples were tested positive for Vibrio Cholerea during this second wave of the outbreak. The outbreak continues to spread at an unprecedented speed throughout Yemen, and over 80% of the districts are affected within a very short period. Only 7 of the 23 governorates in the country recorded over 75% of the new cases and deaths that includes- Amanat Al-Asimah, Hajjah, Al -Hudaydah, Amran, Sana’a, Taizz and Al Mahwit. The capital city of Sana’a and its ten districts reported over 21% of all new cases and 6% of all deaths. Although the overall case fatality rate is still below the acceptable standard of 1%, at least 81 districts recorded over 1% case fatality rate during the last five weeks alone. The source of the current upsurge of cholera cases is presumed to be associated with the contaminated water and food sources combined with poor sanitation and hygiene practices. The MoH with the support of WHO and other partners have scaled up the multi-sectoral response interventions to slow down the spread of the outbreak. During the first two weeks of the second wave, the MoH has made some important policy changes that is expected to improve the cholera data collection and response coverage. The cholera data collection, analysis, and dissemination have been tasked to the surveillance teams at the central governorate and districts levels, and the quality, completeness, and timeliness of the cholera data have significantly improved since then. The MoH has accepted to expand the Diarrhoea Treatment Centers (DTC) and Oral Rehydration centers (ORCs) network across the country.
