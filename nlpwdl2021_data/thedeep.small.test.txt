3266,"  Drought grips large parts of AfghanistanNimroz Province, close to Chakhansur: the ongoing drought has dried up wells, rivers, fountains and water points. Credit: Relief International  A drought is affecting two out of three provinces across Afghanistan, meaning that more than 2 million people are expected to become severely food insecure and in desperate need of life-saving humanitarian assistance in the coming six months.  In recent months, a precipitation deficit of 70 per cent has been registered across most of Afghanistan due to La Niña conditions, and this year’s main harvest is expected to be below average for the fifth consecutive year. Agriculture is one of the country’s main livelihoods, with nearly 15 million people relying on farming, livestock or agriculture-related labour opportunities in the 20 provinces most affected by the drought.  “Afghanistan has three harvests during the year, and we lost the first one, which accounts for about half of the entire harvests,” said Toby Lanzer, the Humanitarian Coordinator for Afghanistan. “I do fear that without quick action now, the number of families affected by the drought will grow precipitously.”  Water points and fountains across the country have dried up, and rivers have run low or dried up. In many cases, farmers could do nothing but watch their seeds dry out and their crops fail. Herders could not find any pastures, and tens of thousands of sheep and goats have died.  With nearly 15 million people relying on farming, livestock or agriculture-related labour opportunities in the 20 provinces most affected by the drought, more than 2 million people are expected to become severely food insecure. Credit: WFP  In the Western Region, which is hardest hit by the drought, farmers have given up hope for the harvest. To save their cattle, they started feeding them with the wheat that could not germinate. More than 20,000 people have already migrated from Badghis and Ghor Provinces, both in the Western Region, to neighbouring Hirat Province due to the drought. They received life-saving humanitarian assistance including food, emergency shelter and essential household items from authorities, United Nations agencies and NGOs.  Complementary to the Government’s response, the humanitarian community is seeking to assist 1.4 million of the most vulnerable girls, boys, women and men affected by the drought as part of the revised financial requirements of the Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP), which now calls for US$117 million in addition to the $430 million requested at the beginning of the year.  “This is a natural disaster, this is not Afghanistan’s fault,” stressed Mr. Lanzer. “We are asking the international community to show real empathy, because people will need either food or cash so that they can access markets where there still is food. If people are given minimum amounts of cash, they will be able to continue to access markets, then we could avert what I have described as untenable hunger six months down the road.”  The Common Humanitarian Fund (CHF) for Afghanistan is already addressing the effects of the drought by providing approximately $1.2 million for food, water, sanitation and drought-tolerant wheat seeds to communities living in the hardest-hit areas of Badghis Province. The CHF was the second largest funder of the 2017 Afghanistan HRP, but contributions are still needed to enable the CHF to deliver urgent and life-saving assistance in 2018 for the drought and other priority humanitarian needs in Afghanistan.",3

This information will assist in triangulating what already appears to be a significant increase in very severe hunger since late 2017, when 8.3 percent of households surveyed by the FSNMS indicated an HHS of six. Further concerning is that the prevalence of global acute malnutrition, as measured by weight-for-height z-score (GAM (WHZ)) was 26.8 percent (22.8-31.2) and severe acute malnutrition (SAM (WHZ)) was 8.0 percent (6.0-10.6), in October 2017, a month of relatively higher food availability than April.

11324,"An animal health event of significance to public health is occurring in Namibia. On 1 October 2017, the wildlife authorities reported deaths of several hippopotamus (hippos) in Bwabwata National Park, Kavango East Region (which borders Botswana and Angola). Two successive aerial surveys conducted on 4 and 7 October 2017 counted 53 and 109 dead hippos, respectively. In addition, 20 buffalos were reported dead in the area. On 11 October 2017, samples collected from the hippo’s carcasses (by veterinary officers) showed Bacillus anthracis on blood smear microscopy. Additional samples were collected from hippos, buffalo and crocodiles and shipped to the Central Veterinary Laboratory for testing. To date, no suspected human cases have been reported. However, there were unconfirmed reports that community members in Kamutjonga village consumed meat from two hippos’ carcasses. This event in wildlife has triggered preparedness and response interventions by the public health authorities, including follow up and investigation of rumours, in order to prevent a possible outbreak of anthrax in humans. On 11 October 2017, dead hippos were reported in the Kavango River in Botswana, adjoining Bwabwata National Park. The river flows through Namibia before entering the Okavango Delta.Although no human infections have been reported thus far, mass animal deaths due to anthrax present a formidable public health risk. Earlier this year, severe human infections were associated with similar events in Zambia (87 suspected cases, 3 deaths) and Zimbabwe (11 suspected cases, 1 death). Immediate risks posed by such animal deaths include handling and consumption of contaminated meat by local communities (causing anthrax infections), as well as potential exposure of local authorities and others while disposing of animal carcasses. As anthrax spores are abundantly present on and inside carcasses, workers are at risk of both cutaneous and inhalational anthrax. Proper use of PPE is essential, as is the safe disposal of animal carcasses to prevent environmental contamination with anthrax spores, incineration being the preferred method. A collective One Health approach, with cross-border collaboration between Namibia, Botswana and Angola is urgently needed to control the event and prevent any human infections.",4

Due to Hurricane Matthew, the number of suspected cholera cases increased from 2,236 (registered between 4 September and 1 October) to 6,096 cases (registered between 4 October and 9 November). About half of these new cases nationwide were reported in Grand’Anse and Sud departments16. Before the hurricane this proportion was only 8 per cent. However, a cholera vaccination campaign held in November reduced transmission in Grand’Anse and Sud departments, and, as of November, the nationwide severe cholera upsurge feared after Matthew, had not occurred.   Still, cholera will remain a serious threat for the most vulnerable Haitians in 2017 as Haiti accounts for 13 per cent of registered cholera deaths worldwide. Haiti also still belongs to the group of 12 countries with a case fatality rate between 1 and 5 per cent. While the number of cholera cases and deaths has decreased since the 2010 outbreak, 35,203 cases and 369 deaths were registered from January to October 2016. This represents a 32 and 56 per cent increase, respectively, in comparison to the same period in 2015. Ouest, Centre, Artibonite and Nord departments remained the most affected in 2016. People’s low access to safe water and sanitation keeps them highly vulnerable to cholera; national capacity also remains weak to deal with the epidemic on its own.

371,"In the Southeast: coffee, litchis, cassava (MG 19), Many households are currently accessing staple food direct from their own harvests since they have recently harvested rice and sweet potatoes and some are still harvesting production not damaged by the floods. Nonetheless, some very poor households have depleted their stocks and are now relying on the markets. Prices of rice are also above normal this year. Cyclone Ava passed through the southeast in early January and aggravated the situation, provoking a second series of floods more severe than those at the end of 2017. The area is in Stressed (IPC Phase 2) acute food insecurity in February 2018. Between March and May, food consumption will deteriorate as very poor will be depleting the ir remaining own stocks. During the same period, some very poor will be already facing food consumption gaps. Consumption of wild food s will be intensified. Incomes will slowly deteriorate as after the rice transplanting and coffee weeding; labor opportunities will decrease and by May very poor households will have limited incomes. Very poor households will employ coping strategies like intensifying basketry or relying on borrowing food/remittances between March and May. Thus, people will likely not easily meet their food needs and will likely face Crisis (IPC Phase 3) between March and May 2018. From June onwards, very poor and poor households will begin to face fewer food consumption gaps with the coming harvests. Low staple prices and more income from rice, coffee and cassava harvesting and cassava planting in August will result in better purchasing power thereby tightening the food consumption gap. Coffee production , expected in June, will likely be near normal due to favorable rainfall, which in turn will provide near normal incomes to households. Therefore, most households in this livelihood zone will experience Stressed (IPC Phase 2) food security outcomes again between June and September 2018.   In the Mahafaly Plain: Cassava, Goats and Cattle (MG 23), the reduced consumption of own produced tubers supplemented by expensive purchased foods made it difficult for poor household to meet their food needs. They are coping by consuming more wild foods . Some migration was also noticed despite the rainy season normally keeping farmers at home to tend to agricultural activities. The prevalence of GAM was below emergency levels in the area with some pockets of severe undernutrition in Itampolo (Ampanihy Districts) and Andranomangatsiaka (District of Betioky) , according to the UNICEF and MoH. Therefore, poor and very poor households in MG23 will likely experience Crisis (IPC Phase 3) acute food insecurity in February 2018. Between March and May, food consumption will improve as the very poor will be able to access green maize and pulses from the new harvest. Consumption of wild foods will reduce but will still provide an important food source for poor households. Sales of wild foods will also reduce but will still likely contribute significantly to income for poor households . But below average agricultural production is expected, which will also reduce cash income for poor households to meet non -food needs. GAM prevalence will likely remain between 7 and 8 percent according to past reference years so the zone may remain in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) between March and May 2018. From June onwards, staple consumption will improve with the availability of stocks from harvests and the resulting lower market prices. Food gaps will be reduced but will remain present because of the expected below average harvests and lower than usual household income. For poor households, activities related to agricultural will be intensified. Most households in this livelihood zone will experience Stressed (IPC Phase 2) food security outcomes between June and September 2018. ",3

The average prevalence of wasting across all four study areas increased from 9.1 percent during the post-harvest season to 14.3 percent during the lean season. The variation was particularly pronounced in the agropastoral livelihood zone.  Although there were no marked differences in the prevalence of child stunting by region, livelihood zone or season, the average prevalence at both time points exceeded 60 percent. Such levels are alarmingly high and call for intensified efforts to prevent chronic undernutrition. Household food insecurity, as defined by the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale or Food Consumption Score, was not independently associated with the odds of being wasted or becoming wasted. In a typical year, the prevalence of child wasting is a poor indicator of the household food security situation. High levels of wasting do not automatically imply a food security crisis. Child morbidity was a consistent risk factor for wasting, reiterating the importance of the infection-undernutrition cycle.

Food availability for rural households is currently improved through the presence of garden produce (lettuce, cabbage, squash, potatoes, etc.) and the start of the operation '' vente de céréales à prix modéré ''. Currently, the average price of millet is above 200 FCFA / kg on almost in all regional capitals. Given these high price levels, access to cereals for poor households is seriously affcted. In the projected situation (June to September 2018), price levels could reach at least 260 FCFA / kg for millet on almost all markets monitored. (Source: Albichir No102 Mars 2018) Analysis of current cross border millet prices shows that price differences are relatively favorable to the import of millet and maize from Malanville in Benin and Illela in Nigeria. Terms of trade for goat versus millet remained almost constant during this month in most livestock markets. For instance, on the market of Abalak / Tahoua which is a pastoral livelhood area, the sale of a goat only allows the breeder to acquire only 35 kg of millet against 36 kg February 2018. This situation could be explained by a stable price of goat and millet on this market. The terms of trade are drastically down from the five-year average which allowed to acquire up to 80 kg of millet. The terms of trade (onion/millet) on the Agadez market indicate a 17% decrease in opportunities for access to onion farmers' cereals. In March 2018, a bag of 100 kilograms of onion trades for 97 kg of millet against 117 kg in February 2018 and 120 kg for the five year average. One could expect an increase in the prices of the main agricultural products, because of the upcoming start of Ramadan, when cereal demand is on the rise.

Respondents mentioned that casual labour was hard to find and lasts only for a day making it not a sustainable source of income. The next day new work needs to be found again. The average casual labour salary in Ar-Raqqa in January is SYP 2,500 per day. High prevalence of child labour was noticed during the assessment. This was a consequence of the destruction in the city where all schools had closed keeping children idle (three schools were opening at the time of the assessment, one each in Ma’amoun, Yarmouk and Qadessiyeh). Moreover, often the main bread winner of the family had been injured, had gone missing or had died. Families were therefore often requiring all members to work in order for the family to earn enough to buy food to eat.

A similar wrangle broke out between Punjab (where the Shiromani Akali Dal, an ally of the BJP, is in power) and New Delhi in 2015, when untimely rain and hailstorm ravaged the wheat crop. The larger issue here is the lack of institutionalised mechanisms to deal with crop loss, despite the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) coming into force.  The fact that less than a third of the affected area in Karnataka this year is covered by insurance (a pointer to inadequate financial inclusion, since the coverage is bundled with crop loans) tells us why political discretion plays such an important role in an agriculture crisis.

2808,"Although aggregate wheat production in 2016 was near-average, some rainfed production areas were adversely affected by rainfall anomalies, particularly in Ghor, Balkh, and Jawzjan Provinces. Rainfed wheat production was also down significantly in Hilmand, Kandahar, and Zabul Provinces, although at least part of this decline was likely due to expanded area under poppy cultivation. Households who experienced substantial losses to their main season harvests in 2016 have experienced increased dependence on labor income for food purchases, and are likely experiencing a more severe lean season than is typical.Although the progression of 2016 agricultural seasons was mostly normal and accompanying agricultural labor opportunities were near average, employment opportunities have remained weak in other sectors such as construction, small private enterprises, and official employment. Population movements away from insecure areas to cities and other more secure areas has increased competition for limited employment opportunities, leading to a decrease in wages offered for casual labor. In eight markets where WFP monitors wheat flour prices and casual labor wages, the average purchasing power of a day of labor in terms of its value in wheat flour (terms of trade) has been notably lower during the past three years (Figure 4). The most significant declines in purchasing power for wheat flour were in Maimana and Mazar-i-Sharif (Figure 5)",3

In addition to reduced access to land, localized dry spells and pests are reportedly affecting crop growth in Tambura and Source Yubu towns and outskirts. Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) reports confirm that although precipitation has been above average, localized dry spells have affected the south western part of the country.6 FGD participants indicated that the harvest yields will likely not be enough to feed the population during the lean season.

To respond to the increasing the risk of disease outbreaks, in June 2017 WHO and the Federal Ministry of Health are improving the Early Warning Alert and Response System (EWARS) – the system that detects outbreaks – by training 264 surveillance officers from 23 health facilities in six states.The EWARS system will allow the early detection of possible outbreaks in areas like camps and overcrowded host communities, where the risk of outbreaks are high.  On 8 June 2017, WHO launched a vaccination campaign in two camps hosting South Sudanese refugees in South and West Kordofan states, with the goal of reaching a total number of 51 525 people over the age of one with the oral cholera vaccine (OCV) through two rounds of vaccinations.  To protect children against vaccine-preventable diseases, WHO and UNICEF supported a mass immunization campaign by the Federal Ministry Of Health in White Nile camps in April 2017 together, during which 1600 children (6 months–15 years old) were vaccinated against measles, and 1680 children (under 5 years) were vaccinated against polio.

9194,"Chad’s economy continues to be strongly impacted by two external elements: the continued decline in oil prices and regional security challenges. These, together with high external debt service burden from commercial debt, have put significant pressure on budgetary resources. Sharp reduction in government expenditures, together with significant investment cuts and layoffs by oil companies, have had strong spillover on the rest of the economy. Non-oil output contracted significantly for a second year in a row and inflation was negative last year. The drop of oil prices shrunk the annual national revenues from US$2billion to US$100million between 2014 and 2016. Internal debt levels are estimated at approximately CFA2,000 billion and external debts are limiting the government spending. (IMF,2017) Two additional non-oil related key revenue sources are also having a major negative spillover to the economy. First, the cotton sector which provides up to 4 million people with a regular revenue is facing important structural issues (high production costs, low international prices). The late salary payments by cotton growers over two successive marketing years have reduced their ability to source food products from markets. In parallel the livestock sector, which is a key revenue to almost the entire rural population, faces major export constraints. The combined effect of insecurity, border closure and a weak Naira, have led to surplus of estimated 20 million cattle in Kanem, Lac and Bar El Ghazal. Livestock prices have plunged by 60% since 2014. Since September 2016, the government reacted with austerity measures whose effects can be noted in various sectors. Among others, the Government reduced civil servants’ allowances by 50%, cut salaries by up to 30% and suspended university scholarships. Schools remained closed during this period as do most government-run hospitals. The government’s most recent measures suspended any free basic health services. This will cutoff the most deprived from health services. (previous issue: vam.wfp.org) The government will likely not provide any agricultural support (distribution of seeds and fertilizer) this agricultural season. This decision will negatively affect the 2017/2018 agricultural production. With the above-mentioned economic challenges a food security deterioration is inevitable in the coming months. While Chad is not facing any major security threats internally, the country is surrounded by new and protracted conflicts creating a potential source for instability in the country. The CAR crisis continues to push more migrants into to Chad. In the East, refugees have arrived from Sudan. The North of the country is facing security threats along the Libyan border (only recently the border has been reopened). Instability in Libya has also led to an increased return of Chadian to their home villages and therefore decreasing incomes from abroad. The Boko Haram crisis has led to displacement of approximately 2.7million people around Lake Chad. More specifically, a large number of fishermen had to leave their islands and resettle on the main land cutting them off from their main source of income. Here, young men (15-25 ages) have been specifically affected and are in constant search for work. In view of all of this, it is critical to underline that the government is in need for additional loans from international donors and banks in the coming months. Without it the country would be likely to suffer from internal instability beyond the capital city because of a prolonged economic crisis.",3

Additionally, accompanying people with disabilities to the immunisation points would be highly appreciated. • Greater visibility of the Red Cross Red Crescent contribution should be ensured in future through the mass media in order to strengthen the image of RCST as a humanitarian organisation; • Regular contacts both official or unofficial should be maintained with government bodies in the field; • Regular contacts should be maintained with organisations/government bodies/private sector where RCST volunteers are employed in order to speed up mobilisation in case of an emergency; • Visibility of RCST should be given more attention when implementing any activities. Conclusions: • Cooperation needs to be improved with health sector, including with REACT Health Sector; government bodies, international organisations and NGOs – based on relevant cooperation agreements, and a participatory approach involving provincial, district-level and local authorities/community leaders. • Regular trainings as well as information sessions need to be conducted for National Society branch staff and volunteers, using good practices and lessons learned in the field of national immunisation campaigns and activities, including dissemination of information materials to enhance Red Cross Red Crescent visibility.

Cholera transmission continues to decline countrywide, with new confirmed or suspected cases reported only in Central Equatoria’s Juba County, Eastern Equatoria’s Budi County, and Jonglei’s Fangak County since late September, according to health actors. Health actors in Budi have recorded more than 660 suspected cholera cases, including 61 related deaths, in the county since July; relief agencies are providing case management support to local health authorities to mitigate further spread of the outbreak. Since late September, health actors have recorded at least 88 suspected cholera cases in Juba, where humanitarian organizations recently reached nearly 173,000 people through an oral cholera vaccination (OCV) campaign. Meanwhile, health actors in Fangak have not recorded new suspected cholera cases in the county since confirming and treating seven cases in late September. ? On October 25, the national cholera task force—chaired by the GoRSS Ministry of Health (MoH), with support from UN agencies and other humanitarian organizations—convened to review the current cholera caseload and status of response activities in South Sudan. As part of ongoing response efforts, health actors are deploying OCV doses to locations with active transmission to prevent further spread of the disease, transporting more than 1.1 million OCV doses to high-risk areas to date in 2017. Response organizations recently completed the third round of an OCV campaign in Eastern Equatoria’s Kapoeta North County, reaching more than 10,100 people from October 16–21. ? As of October 27, health actors had recorded nearly 21,300 suspected cholera cases, including 436 related deaths, since the beginning of the outbreak in June 2016, according to the MoH and WHO. Cumulative caseloads are highest in Eastern Equatoria’s Kapoeta East and Kapoeta South counties; Jonglei’s Ayod County; Lakes State’s Yirol East 4 County; Upper Nile State’s Fashoda County; and Warrap State’s Tonj East County, with the most affected populations including those residing along the Nile River, near cattle camps, and in areas that lack access to social services. ? Heavy rainfall and resultant floods have displaced more than 14,400 households—approximately 71,700 people—in Jonglei’s Pibor town and surrounding areas in recent weeks, according to a mid-October interagency assessment. In recent weeks, flooding has destroyed agricultural fields and restricted access to markets, contributing to higher food prices and increasing reliance on food assistance. Humanitarian actors also report an urgent need for shelter materials and emergency relief items for both displaced populations and host communities. In addition, floodwaters have damaged the town’s two health care facilities and submerged critical WASH infrastructure, including boreholes and latrines, increasing the risk of waterborne diseases, according to the assessment. In response, relief actors are coordinating with local health authorities to provide basic mobile health care services in Pibor. ? In response to humanitarian needs exacerbated by the floods, USAID/OFDA partner Vétérinaires Sans Frontìeres/Germany (VSF/G) is repairing WASH infrastructure in Pibor and preparing to respond to potential increased incidence of livestock disease.

375,"S ituat ion Overv iew   On 26 February 2018, a 7.5 magnitude earthquake hit the Highlands Region of Papua New Guinea (PNG), affecting an estimated 544,000 people in five provinces – Enga, Gulf, Hela, Southern Highlands and Western provinces, with Hela and Southern Highlands the most affected. More than 270,000 people, including 125,000 children, have been left in immediate need of life-saving assistance. Since the initial 26 February earthquake, at least 195 aftershocks have occurred, of which six were of a 6.0 or greater magnitude.   The latest tracking figures available from the Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) implemented as part of the Shelter Cluster response, indicate that 11,041 households (42,577 people) remain displaced due to the earthquake, of which 1,252 households (24 per cent) are displaced in nine care centres while 9,789 households remain within their communities. The number of people registered as staying in care centres continues to fluctuate, and the overall number of displaced may rise as new assessments are carried out .   The Shelter Cluster has adopted common definitions of settlement types defining a care centre as a displacement site where people are hosted away from their community or area of origin , and affected community as a community where people are still living within their community, even if displaced locally from their damaged/destroyed home. Two shelter response options and recommended packages have been proposed for cluster members’   + For more information, see “background on the crisis” at the end of the report   https://www.humanitarianresponse.info/en/operations/papua-new-guinea   PNG Disaster Management Team    Papua New Guinea - Highlands Earthquake Situation Report No. 8 | 2   endorsement corresponding to the two target groups defined above: (1) IDP household Shelter-NFI return kit (for those in care centres); and (2) community reconstruction toolkit (for affected communities). The Food Security Cluster advises that affected households still living in their communities and thereby having access to land should also be supported with agriculture and other recovery kits, and that this could help promote return of other displaced people.   More than 80 per cent of health facilities in Hela and Southern Highlands (69 of 86) are open and functional, but 13 of these health facilities sustained severe structural damage that continues to pose serious occupational threats to all users. Refurbishment of earthquake related structural damages remains a challenge. In particular, 55 per cent of health facilities urgently need access to safe water sources.   Traditional water sources were destroyed by earthquake-induced landslides and landslips. Water quality testing is already underway, with capacity to sample and test water in sources suspected to be contaminated established in Southern Highlands province. The Health Cluster reports that the results of the water testing of the Kikori River in Gulf province showed no heavy metal contamination. However, bacteriological analysis showed heavy coliform presence which may result in water -borne diseases. The lack of access to safe drinking water significantly increases risks of water-borne diseases outbreak among affected and displaced persons. Gastrointestinal and diarrheal diseases due to poor water and sanitation are increasing , with a cumulative total of 181 cases reported from nine health facilities in Hela and Southern Highlands provinces.   A mass vaccination campaign is scheduled to begin at the end of April covering all children under five years of age in five districts of Southern Highlands Province: Lalibu Pangia, Imboggu, Kagua Erave, Mendi Munihu, and Nipa Kutubu.   Nutrition service provision has started at Mendi General Hospital, Urila Poroma Care Center, Tamenda Health Sub centre and Pimaga Rural in Southern Highlands province, with 62 children screened for Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) of which two were hospitalized. A total of 1,240 children are targeted to receive treatment for Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM). To date, 14 community health workers and 13 nurses, nutritionists, and medical officers (out of 120 targeted for training) have been oriented in SAM management.   Since 28 March, most humanitarian programmes in and around Tari, the provincial capital of Hela province, have been suspended due to increased tension and inter-communal fighting. Many partners have temporarily relocated humanitarian staff to other locations, including to the Southern Highlands provincial capital, Mendi, in view of the situation. Humanitarian partners aim to resume relief work as soon as the security situation allows. While the situation seemed to calm for a period, tensions were reportedly rising again since 19 April. ",1

For millions of Venezuelans suffering an unprecedented economic crisis, a monthly handout of a box of heavily-subsidized basic food supplies by Maduro’s unpopular government has offered a tenuous lifeline in their once-prosperous OPEC nation. The 55-year-old successor to Hugo Chavez introduced the so-called CLAP boxes in 2016 in a signature policy of his rule, continuing the socialist government’s strategy of seeking public support with cash bonuses and other giveaways. “I and other women I know are going to vote for Maduro because he’s promising to keep giving CLAPs, which at least help fix some problems,” said the 30-year-old cook, who asked not to give her surname for fear of losing the benefit. “When you earn minimum wage, which doesn’t cover exorbitant prices, the box helps.” Stamped with the faces of Maduro and Chavez, the CLAP boxes usually contain rice, pasta, grains, cooking oil, powdered milk, canned tuna and other basic goods. Recipients pay 25,000 bolivars per box, or about $0.12 at the black market rate.

3861,"78 per cent of the 120,000 children born in Lebanon to Syrian refugees do not have their birth registered with the competent authority.Statelessness puts Syrian refugees at riskStatelessness is a risk for Syrian refugees, especially children born to refugees since the start of the Syria crisis. UNHCR estimates that over the last seven years, approximately 120,000 children have been born in Lebanon to Syrian refugees. Around 78 per cent do not have their birth registered with the competent authority (the Foreigners’ Registry), and over 50,000 children under five years do not have a birth certificate registered with the Nofous, the local registry office. Birth registration and nationality are essential to protect individual rights; statelessness can lead to legal and socioeconomic marginalization, and has been linked to increased vulnerability to trafficking and recruitment of child soldiers. Registration with the Foreigners’ Registry and documentation of nationality will also be essential for eventual returns of refugees to Syria.Obstacles to birth registration and acquisition of Syrian nationality by refugees include a lack of awareness, unfamiliarity with procedures (which can differ markedly from those in Syria), prohibitive costs (particularly where parents have failed to regis ter a birth within a year), and lack of registration among parents. Government entities have been working to combat this problem, working with municipalities and local authorities. NGOs and UN agencies have also been active in providing legal support and raising awareness. However, more still needs to be done, including possible amendments to nationality and personal status laws, increasing awareness of the need for registration and the proper procedures among refugees and local authorities, and ensuring that accessible avenues exist for refugees to register, including minimizing costs and administrative obstacles.

5233,"The response in north-east Nigeria is marked by access challenges that undermine the safe and predictable movement of personnel and relief materials. These include a volatile security situation, limited road access during the rainy season and poor road infrastructure. In addition, the recent scale-up of the response and the growing number of aid workers in the region have resulted in a need for enhanced coordination and information sharing, as well as improved use of available resources, to support the Government of Nigeria and humanitarian agencies working in the response. Key logistics needs identified in 201730 include: • Enhanced need for coordination with the military, particularly for informationsharing on security and coordination of escort arrangements for trucks carrying relief items to field locations; • Enhanced need of storage capacity in field locations, in addition to the ones initially identified, for temporary storage for humanitarian cargo; • Need for information on physical access, including planning for the impact of the rainy season on the humanitarian response; • Need for capacity-building for national logistics humanitarian aid workers; • Need for enhanced engagement and cooperation with local bodies (SEMA, Ministry of Works and Transport, National Union of Road Transport, etc.). Humanitarian organisations also require ongoing humanitarian air services for both passenger and cargo movements to ensure continuous access to beneficiaries and project implementation sites. Identified gaps in this regard include: • Lack of sufficient local services to maintain the link between the capital city, Abuja, and destinations in northeast Nigeria where the response is taking place; • Lack of access to remote areas: due to road insecurity, long waiting times at checkpoints and threats of hostilities or attack, most response areas cannot be reached by road; where there are no landing strips for airplanes, the only option to access the sites is by helicopter; • Lack of local capacity for medical and security evacuations of humanitarian staff. The challenging security situation exposes humanitarian workers to threats when accessing affected people. The UN Humanitarian Air Service (UNHAS) operation was established to facilitate the access of humanitarian personnel and support the delivery of urgently required cargo in hardto-reach areas. The humanitarian community relies extensively on air operations to deliver their programmes, conduct assessment or monitoring missions and transport light cargo to hard-to-reach areas. The need for air services has increased in 2017 in line with the expansion of humanitarian activities in north-east Nigeria, including an increase of human resources on the ground. Taking into consideration that 80 per cent of Borno State is considered high or very high risk for humanitarian actors, UNHAS has gained an ever important role in the transportation of aid workers and life-saving relief items.",6
9326,"Since the beginning of 2017, around 3,829 suspected cases of measles, a viral respiratory infection that spreads through air and contact with infected mucus and saliva, have been reported. Banadir, Galgudud, Hirshabelle and Somaliland account for 88 per cent of all cases, with Somaliland alone reporting 1,401 suspected cases. Out of the 116 affected districts by measles, 77 are largely accessible, while 39 districts are more hard to reach, and the likelihood for underreporting of suspected measles cases is high. Measles can only be prevented through immunization, but once the disease has broken out, it is only possible to treat the symptoms, which include fever, cough, rashes and muscle aches. Particularly in malnourished children and people with reduced immunity, measles can cause serious complications, including blindness, encephalitis, severe diarrhoea, ear infection and pneumonia. Women infected while pregnant are also at risk of severe complications and the pregnancy may end in miscarriage or preterm delivery. In Somalia, 54% of all suspected measles cases have been reported in children between 1–4 years of age.",4

However, this strategy was challenged by unforeseen policy limitations from the government. Most of the directly affected population are poor squatters residing in undesignated land within city pockets. The government classified the settlement sites as risky and would not allow any permanent presence and / or any intent to live in the original villages classified as undesignated places. The government opted for relocation to a site designated ‘six-miles’ on the condition that all shelter support was to be permanent/ concrete housing as it was already constructing public housing units as a means to decongest the city and to provide dwellings for the houseless. Compliance to the conditions at the sixmiles site was an immediate challenge.
