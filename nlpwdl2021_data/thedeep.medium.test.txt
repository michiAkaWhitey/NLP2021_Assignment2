1303,"78 per cent of the 120,000 children born in Lebanon to Syrian refugees do not have their birth registered with the competent authority.Statelessness puts Syrian refugees at riskStatelessness is a risk for Syrian refugees, especially children born to refugees since the start of the Syria crisis. UNHCR estimates that over the last seven years, approximately 120,000 children have been born in Lebanon to Syrian refugees. Around 78 per cent do not have their birth registered with the competent authority (the Foreigners’ Registry), and over 50,000 children under five years do not have a birth certificate registered with the Nofous, the local registry office. Birth registration and nationality are essential to protect individual rights; statelessness can lead to legal and socioeconomic marginalization, and has been linked to increased vulnerability to trafficking and recruitment of child soldiers. Registration with the Foreigners’ Registry and documentation of nationality will also be essential for eventual returns of refugees to Syria.Obstacles to birth registration and acquisition of Syrian nationality by refugees include a lack of awareness, unfamiliarity with procedures (which can differ markedly from those in Syria), prohibitive costs (particularly where parents have failed to regis ter a birth within a year), and lack of registration among parents. Government entities have been working to combat this problem, working with municipalities and local authorities. NGOs and UN agencies have also been active in providing legal support and raising awareness. However, more still needs to be done, including possible amendments to nationality and personal status laws, increasing awareness of the need for registration and the proper procedures among refugees and local authorities, and ensuring that accessible avenues exist for refugees to register, including minimizing costs and administrative obstacles.

These conditions have negatively and irreversibly impacted the winter of 2017-2018 agricultural season and are expected to also negatively impact the spring and summer of 2018 agricultural season in Afghanistan.

Moderate (50-100 mm) to locally heavy (200-300 mm) precipitation occurred over central, north-western, and eastern parts of the country during the months of March and April. However, cumulative seasonal precipitation deficits remain significant in most areas, especially in the north and southwestern parts of the country.

17331,"An animal health event of significance to public health is occurring in Namibia. On 1 October 2017, the wildlife authorities reported deaths of several hippopotamus (hippos) in Bwabwata National Park, Kavango East Region (which borders Botswana and Angola). Two successive aerial surveys conducted on 4 and 7 October 2017 counted 53 and 109 dead hippos, respectively. In addition, 20 buffalos were reported dead in the area. On 11 October 2017, samples collected from the hippo’s carcasses (by veterinary officers) showed Bacillus anthracis on blood smear microscopy. Additional samples were collected from hippos, buffalo and crocodiles and shipped to the Central Veterinary Laboratory for testing. To date, no suspected human cases have been reported. However, there were unconfirmed reports that community members in Kamutjonga village consumed meat from two hippos’ carcasses. This event in wildlife has triggered preparedness and response interventions by the public health authorities, including follow up and investigation of rumours, in order to prevent a possible outbreak of anthrax in humans. On 11 October 2017, dead hippos were reported in the Kavango River in Botswana, adjoining Bwabwata National Park. The river flows through Namibia before entering the Okavango Delta.Although no human infections have been reported thus far, mass animal deaths due to anthrax present a formidable public health risk. Earlier this year, severe human infections were associated with similar events in Zambia (87 suspected cases, 3 deaths) and Zimbabwe (11 suspected cases, 1 death). Immediate risks posed by such animal deaths include handling and consumption of contaminated meat by local communities (causing anthrax infections), as well as potential exposure of local authorities and others while disposing of animal carcasses. As anthrax spores are abundantly present on and inside carcasses, workers are at risk of both cutaneous and inhalational anthrax. Proper use of PPE is essential, as is the safe disposal of animal carcasses to prevent environmental contamination with anthrax spores, incineration being the preferred method. A collective One Health approach, with cross-border collaboration between Namibia, Botswana and Angola is urgently needed to control the event and prevent any human infections.",4

But, in the absence of government confirmed information about the level of registration, information sharing to ensure informed decision making and information on planned areas of resettlement we are particularly concerned that these movements may not be voluntary, based on well-informed decisions or safe.This is exacerbated by a context of rumours reported by IDPs that aid will be stopped in places like Maiduguri, that camps could be closed at the end of May 2017, and that aid is readily accessible in other locations to which people are being encouraged to move.The humanitarian community has not received timely information in order to plan for or receive new arrivals, and many sites identified by the authorities for return are already at maximum capacity and cannot support further population increases. In almost all instances, there is insufficient shelter, water, food, health, no education services and this has further exacerbated existing protection risks. These movements therefore pose risks and challenges to those displaced and for those already living in these sites. ",6

27879,"The effective denial of citizenship for the Rohingya—who are not recognized on the official list of 135 ethnic groups eligible for full citizenship under the 1982 Citizenship Law—has facilitated enduring rights abuses, including restrictions on movement; limitations on access to health care, livelihood, shelter, and education; arbitrary arrests and detention; and forced labor. Travel is severely constrained by authorization requirements, security checkpoints, curfews, and strict control of IDP camp access. Such barriers compound the health crisis caused by poor living conditions, severe overcrowding, and limited health facilities.  The government refuses to use the term Rohingya, which the group self-identifies as but is rejected by nationalist Buddhists in favor of the term “Bengali,” which implies illegal migrant status in Burma. Aung San Suu Kyi refers to the group as the “Muslim Community in Rakhine State,” and has requested that international stakeholders, including the United States, European Union, and United Nations, follow suit.

According to the preliminary findings of a joint FAO/WFP Crop and Food Security Assessment Mission (CFSAM) conducted in January 2017, the 2016 aggregate production of food crops increased by 16 percent from the sharply-reduced 2015 output, mainly due to an increase in cassava production (+26 percent), but still remained 17 percent below the pre-crisis five-year average (2008-2012). The cereal output increased by a 9 percent from 2015, but is 30 percent lower than the pre-crisis average.

An HHS of six signifies an extreme lack of food indicative of Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5). These data are not statistically representative; however, the severity is significant enough to warrant urgent response. Further efforts are underway to triangulate these findings, including SMART surveys in Pibor and Kapoeta East in May, identification and analysis of available admission data, and rapid assessments by FEWS NET in both Pibor and Kapoeta East. This information will assist in triangulating what already appears to be a significant increase in very severe hunger since late 2017, when 8.3 percent of households surveyed by the FSNMS indicated an HHS of six. Further concerning is that the prevalence of global acute malnutrition, as measured by weight-for-height z-score (GAM (WHZ)) was 26.8 percent (22.8-31.2) and severe acute malnutrition (SAM (WHZ)) was 8.0 percent (6.0-10.6), in October 2017, a month of relatively higher food availability than April. This GAM (WHZ) was near the Famine (IPC Phase 5) threshold of 30 percent, and it is possible malnutrition has further increased since October.

Learning centres are running at capacity and are unable to enrol more primary aged children. For adolescents, lack of overall services is the main barrier. ? Distance to learning centres was reported as barrier especially by parents of younger children and then gradually declining with age. 40% of parents for 3-5, 30% for 6-14 and 26% for 15-18. This was linked to challenging terrain—especially during rainy season—as well as dealing with hazards and threats along the way (see below). ? Safety threats at learning centres was identified as access barrier particularly by girls, and cited as priority area for improvement. The specific nature of threats remained unidentified by this assessment 01/06/2018 5 and requires further analysis. This was more acute for girls than boys at age 6-14 (32% vs 25%) and aged 15-18 (32% vs 18%). ? CGD discussions suggested adolescent girls were concerned not having gender-segregated classrooms and learning centres being unsecure from intrusions leading to a degree of shame in attending education. Given the overall lack of services for adolescents, this should be interpreted as the perception of adolescent female respondents on access barriers. Furthermore secondary Data contradicts these findings, repeatedly citing that learning centres are perceived as safe spaces. ? CGD data suggest that for adolescent girls, these concerns are exacerbated due to the fact that those learning spaces that do exist are not gender-segregated classrooms, and that spaces are not secure from intrusion by people who should not be able to enter the space, such as men from the immediate community physically entering or observing activities inside learning facilities. ? Work at home or outside home was identified as barrier by 20% of parents of primary aged children (6- 14). The percentage increases to approximately 50% with parents of adolescents (15-18), while the lack of education possibilities might negatively impact this figure. ? Around 40% of parents of adolescent girls and 33% for adolescent boys reported that education was not appropriate for children of their age. This is likely linked to conservative social norms constraining mixing with the opposite sex and restricting movement outside the household after the onset of puberty, as well as the belief that education is of limited use for girls who will grow up to fulfil primarily domestic responsibilities. ? Mental health and disability were not mentioned as barriers by the study’s survey, which is in contradiction with secondary data analysis indicating psychosocial trauma linked with displacement being a factor limiting children’s abilities to access education.",2

17814,"Conflict, displacement, and economic decline are placing severe pressure on essential basic services and the institutions that provide them, pushing them towards total collapse. Humanitarian programmes in Yemen are predicated on an assumption of at least minimal functionality of state services in key sectors like health, water, education and social protection. However, growing evidence points to imminent institutional collapse across large swathes of the country. The Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation (MOPIC) in Sana’a reports that Central Bank foreign exchange reserves dropped from $4.7 billion in late 2014 to less than $1 billion in September 2016. The public budget deficit has nearly doubled in the last year, to about $1.8 billion. Salaries for health facility staff, teachers and other public sector workers go increasingly unpaid, leaving 1.25 million state employees and their 6.9 million dependents – or nearly 30 per cent of the population – without an income at a time of shortages and rising prices. Despite Government commitments to the contrary, relocation of the Central Bank to Aden had not resolved salary arrears as of late October. State-provided social services are rapidly collapsing while needs are surging. In August, the Ministry of Public Health and Population (MOPHP) in Sana’a announced it could no longer cover operational costs for health services. As of October 2016, only 45 per cent of health facilities were functional; this rate falls below 25 per cent  in five governorates, including Marib, Al Jawf and Al Dhale’e. Absenteeism among key staff – doctors, nutrition counsellors, teachers – is reportedly rising as employees seek alternatives to provide for their families. On top of pressure to compensate for a faltering commercial sector, humanitarian partners are fielding calls to fill gaps created by collapsing public institutions, which is beyond both their capacity and remit. It is essential for all stakeholders to stem this collapse, including through selective re-engagement of development programmes, which have been largely frozen since early 2015. ",1

31369,"June to September 2018: Food security is projected to decrease seasonally in June with the depletion of household food stocks in marginal areas and reduction in milk availability and livestock prices in pastoral areas. However, the decline is likely to be atypically earlier in areas that receive poor long rains and experience below-average replenishment of forage and water resources. In July, the long rains crop harvests, though likely below average, will temporarily improve food security in the marginal agricultural areas by providing casual wage labor income-earning opportunities and increasing household food availability through early August. Income from this source might be minimal, especially in areas if there is crop failure. As household stocks are likely to be depleted by mid-August, poor households are expected to seek additional income from casual wage labor, bee keeping, petty trade, and charcoal burning. In pastoral areas, the lean period will likely begin atypically early in July as pastoralists migrate in search of forage and water, and incomes fall from livestock and livestock product sales. This is expected to lead to a reduction in food access and consumption, resulting in high malnutrition. In order to meet their minimum food needs, poor households will intensify their employment of coping strategies, such as increased reliance on non-livestock related income sources, such as charcoal sales, remittances, humanitarian assistance, and safety nets. During this period, overall, in the marginal agricultural areas, the majority of poor households are expected to be in Stressed (IPC Phase 2). However, if there is total long rains crop failure in some areas, some very poor households may experience Crisis (IPC Phase 3)outcomes. In pastoral areas, Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are likely to persist in most of Isiolo, as well as parts of Mandera, Wajir, and Garissa, as well as some poor households in Tana River. While improvements from the long rains are expected to allow the majority of other pastoral areas to remain in Stressed (IPC Phase 2), as the lean season continues through September, FEWS NET expects a widespread increase in the number of poor households experiencing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes. However, the total number of the population of these other counties is expected to be less than 20 percent.",3

Accordingly, pasture regeneration is expected in areas where fall/deyr rains have started, which will reduce the need for emergency feed distribution. However, pastures will be exhausted earlier than in normal years and emergency feed will be needed as early as January 2018 to protect pastoralist households from falling into destitution.",0

Additionally, accompanying people with disabilities to the immunisation points would be highly appreciated. • Greater visibility of the Red Cross Red Crescent contribution should be ensured in future through the mass media in order to strengthen the image of RCST as a humanitarian organisation; • Regular contacts both official or unofficial should be maintained with government bodies in the field; • Regular contacts should be maintained with organisations/government bodies/private sector where RCST volunteers are employed in order to speed up mobilisation in case of an emergency; • Visibility of RCST should be given more attention when implementing any activities. Conclusions: • Cooperation needs to be improved with health sector, including with REACT Health Sector; government bodies, international organisations and NGOs – based on relevant cooperation agreements, and a participatory approach involving provincial, district-level and local authorities/community leaders. • Regular trainings as well as information sessions need to be conducted for National Society branch staff and volunteers, using good practices and lessons learned in the field of national immunisation campaigns and activities, including dissemination of information materials to enhance Red Cross Red Crescent visibility.

21120,"October 2017 to January 2018: From October, the long rains harvest from the high and medium-producing areas is expected to improve food availability and access, slightly easing staple food prices, generally improving food security outcomes. However, the atypical extension of rains into the harvesting period is likely to result in post-harvest losses, reducing the supply, and maintaining maize prices at 24 – 26 percent above average. The short rains are expected to improve forage and water availability, resulting in improved food and milk consumption across most of the country. Nurses’ return to work is expected to increase health and nutrition activities, leading to typical improvements usually observed in nutritional status from late November through January. At a macro level, regional and international maize imports are expected to increase by 50 percent from January onwards, following increased availability from harvests in Ethiopia and Uganda, increasing supply and moderating atypically early and rapid price increases. With the availability of the long rains harvest and regional and international imports facilitating good food access, the high and medium-producing areas are likely to experience Minimal (IPC Phase 1) outcomes. By mid to late December, across the pastoral areas, there are expected improvements, which will be largely reflected in higher livestock productivity levels. This is likely to lead to higher food and income sources and an improvement to Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes. In some eastern pastoral areas, even if total cumulative rainfall is below-average, the short rains are still likely to be sufficient to register an improvement in forage and water resources since the rainfall deficits were not as severe during the 2017 long rains in most areas, outside of Isiolo. However, emergency humanitarian assistance will still likely be required for some of the most vulnerable households, who will still experience Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes at the end of January.

The greatest concern is for approximately 4,000 of these families who have not been allocated any funding for reconstruction and see no end in sight to their displacement. Internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Gaza face a range of challenges and protection concerns. These were reflected in a comprehensive survey carried out by humanitarian partners, under OCHA coordination, in the second half of 2015. Concerns include overcrowding and lack of privacy, limited access to basic services, a decline in the quantity and diversity of food consumed, risk of gender-based violence, and exposure to weather extremes and unexploded ordnance. These factors exacerbate the vulnerability of certain groups, particularly female-headed households, children and persons with disabilities. Over 60 per cent of IDP households currently stay in rented accommodation, according to a Shelter Cluster assessment; given the limited housing stock, it is believed that some of these families are in fact renting space in the homes of extended family. The remaining families reside in their damaged homes, with relatives, in pre-fabricated units, in makeshift shelters, or have other arrangements.",10

19728,": The water and sanitation situation in the flooded districts is alarming, especially because floodwater has filled up latrines, contaminating water sources and limiting the availability of safe drinking water. A report issued by the UN estimates that around 184,000 latrines have been washed away or totally damaged while approximately 54,000 tube wells have been partially or fully damaged. Due to contamination of water sources – especially tube wells, which are the main source of safe water in affected areas – the affected population is seeking alternative and unsafe water sources, which may lead to outbreak of water borne diseases, and exacerbate any pre-disaster health and nutrition issues. As such, provision of safe water is a pressing need. This needs to be accompanied with provision of safe water collection and storage containers. There is also a need for improving immediate and medium-term access to sanitation, including by constructing emergency latrines. Hygiene promotion, accompanied with provision of hygiene items, will be key in reducing the risk of water borne and water related diseases. Furthermore, since the floods have damaged not only people’s homes but also community and school water and sanitation facilities, after the relief phase there will be a need to rehabilitate damaged community water systems, water and sanitation facilities in schools and latrines for damaged houses. The damage to sanitation structures affects girls and women more, especially as they were already facing challenges in accessing safe and accessible sanitation and hygiene facilities prior to the floods. Girls and women have also highlighted the need for menstrual hygiene support. To address specific needs of girls and women, menstrual hygiene management in the form of culturally relevant sanitary napkins is necessary",11

Main crops such as maize and beans are developing well, leading to good prospects for harvests in June/July. Demand for agricultural labor has remained steady during the April to June lean season and should increase in the coming months as Printemps harvests coincide with preparation for the Eté agricultural season.  In Sud and Grand’Anse departments, maize crops planted in February are developing normally.

In PoCs and collective sites, the cluster targets 100% of the population due to the nature of the displacement; however, the package received is lighter to balance the equality of the response inside and outside of the PoCs. Outside of PoCs, the needs may be broader than in PoCs. Nonetheless, given the logistical challenges, the cluster rarely prioritizes shelter assistance, except in stable areas with returnee caseloads where there is availability of native shelter materials and possibility to implement longer-term interventions.In general, outside ofcamps, the main identified needs are related to lack of access to essential life-sustaining household NFI items.",10

7513,"Even though there are no official figures that distinguish registered returnees by ethnic or religious group, it is generally believed that only a few of them belong to the Muslim communities that fled at the beginning of the conflict. Based on the evidence gathered during this research, the large majority of the Muslim returnees currently live in enclaves. The reasons for returning to an enclave are quite straightforward. Muslims are encouraged to do so by the traditional solidarity within their own community. Also, international forces can easily protect enclaves in case of new attacks. Finally, returning to an enclave allows both returnees and “stayees” — those who remained in the country — to avoid tackling extremely sensitive issues, such as land and property rights, and reparations. Enclaves could therefore become a buffer zone where the social and political issues that triggered the conflict are confined, and tackling them with reconciliation programs is not as compelling as providing basic assistance to the population living there.",9

Prices of other important food staples followed similar patterns, with wheat and cassava prices increasing by 45-56 percent between February and April and prices of groundnuts more than doubling over the same period. Overall, in April, staple food prices in Juba were between two and more than five times their levels in April last year, due to insecurity, a tight supply situation, hyper-inflation and a significant depreciation of the local currency.",3

Sorghum, which has a longer growing cycle, will be harvested as usual in December/January. The rainy season is expected to end normally in October in the extreme northern areas and central states, and will continue into December in the southern region. Coupled with increased land cultivated and favorable rainfall distribution and amount, as well as increased access to inputs during the growing season, national staple harvests are likely to be near average to above average for most crops in most areas.

The deterioration is because poor crop harvests are expected in marginal agriculture areas, and regeneration pasture and browse to support livestock production in pastoral areas is likely to be below average. Other causes of increased food insecurity include: (i) maize infestation by Fall and African armyworm; (ii) a steep increase in prices of staple foods; and (iii) resource-based conflicts.

The south of Syria does not grow enough wheat to be self-sufficient, producing an estimated 80% of its own need in 2016. This gap increases significantly when looking at flour. The assessment suggested that local milling contributes only 15% of the flour needed to serve the population while humanitarian aid meets 30-40%. This suggests that as much as half of total flour need is left unmet. All 94 local councils identified the lack of flour as the biggest challenge to meeting bread need.  Infrastructure mapping illustrated that bakery systems in the south have proven relatively resistant to conflict. Distinct regions of interconnected infrastructure centered around private and public bakeries have developed in eastern Dar’a and western Dar’a/Quneitra. As local production remains lacking, large amounts of flour distributed as aid has kept bread prices constant and affordable. However, there are signs that it is distorting the market for flour.

In the first quarter of 2016, child deaths and injuries increased by 19 per cent compared to the last quarter of 2015 (increased from 374 to 445 children). Furthermore, verification of recruitment and use cases of children have increased by 35 per cent compared to the last quarter of 2015 (increase in verified cases from 103 to 140). The abduction and arbitrary detention of children continued through-out the year of 2016. The conflict is also taking a toll on children’s access to education. Schools have been hit in the course of ground operations and aerial attacks, and partners estimate that 1,604 schools are currently unfit for use due to damage, presence of IDPs or occupation by armed groups. Some 2 million children are out of school, further jeopardizing their future. Children who have experienced stressful situations are likely to show changes in social relations, behaviour, physical reactions, and emotional response, manifesting as sleeping problems, nightmares, withdrawal, problems concentrating and guilt. These effects are compounded by uncertainty about the future and disruption to routine. ",4

3977,"Food security developments in June suggest drastic regional shifts between north and south of Unity State, since February. Reported access to food notably increased in centraland southern Unity State since February, as shown by comparative Map 3. In June, 80% of assessed settlements in Koch, Leer, Mayendit and Panyijar reported to have adequate access to food, which represents a sharp increase since February when only 25% reported the same. Improvements have been most notable in Leer where 97% of assessed settlement reported adequate access to food in June, compared to only 11% in February, while in Mayendit proportions increased from 25% in February up to 46% in June. These findings suggest that massive scale-up of food assistance has successfully lifted up food security levels in central Unity. However, these positive developments seem to be highly dependent on food assistance being maintained at the same levels, to prevent a relapse into previous conditions of extreme food insecurity. Regular food distributions and access todistributions by beneficiaries, however, heavily depend on security in the area which remains highly volatile and unpredictable.

The reopening of the country’s borders with Libya in early March helped improve supplies in the Borkou-EnnediTibesti (BET) regions. In spite of the atypical pattern of trade limited to three border crossings, it is improving the household food security situation. Thus, parts of this livelihood zone have been in the Stressed (IPC Phase 2) phase of food insecurity since June. ? The shortages of pasture and watering holes are creating mediocre pastoral conditions in Kanem, BEG, Batha, Guera, Ouaddaï, Wadi Fira, and Ennedi. On average, animals are traveling 15 to 20 kilometers to drink and graze on pasture. This is affecting their physical condition and reproductive performance, reducing milk production, and driving down livestock prices on most markets. ?

As the cases reportedly started on 4 June, two weeks after the start of the conflict, health experts see this as an alarming effect of the displacement. The government has confirmed 11 cases of cholera. As disease surveillance is very limited due to inaccessibility of the displacement sites, especially those close to the conflict zone, humanitarian agencies are concerned that cases are increasing without due attention.  The capacity to prevent the increasing cases of AWD and cholera is low, as 82% of the displaced population has no access to adequate sanitation facilities and 35% have no access to safe drinking water.

A report issued by the UN estimates that around 184,000 latrines have been washed away or totally damaged while approximately 54,000 tube wells have been partially or fully damaged. Due to contamination of water sources – especially tube wells, which are the main source of safe water in affected areas – the affected population is seeking alternative and unsafe water sources, which may lead to outbreak of water borne diseases, and exacerbate any pre-disaster health and nutrition issues. As such, provision of safe water is a pressing need. This needs to be accompanied with provision of safe water collection and storage containers. There is also a need for improving immediate and medium-term access to sanitation, including by constructing emergency latrines. Hygiene promotion, accompanied with provision of hygiene items, will be key in reducing the risk of water borne and water related diseases. Furthermore, since the floods have damaged not only people’s homes but also community and school water and sanitation facilities, after the relief phase there will be a need to rehabilitate damaged community water systems, water and sanitation facilities in schools and latrines for damaged houses. The damage to sanitation structures affects girls and women more, especially as they were already facing challenges in accessing safe and accessible sanitation and hygiene facilities prior to the floods.

Escalating conflict and displacement are also associated with greater risks and incidence of gender-based violence (GBV), including sexual abuse. Focus group discussions have shown that women report psychological distress due to violence, fear for family members, and fear of arrest or detention, while men report distress due to loss of livelihoods, restricted mobility, and being forced to perform “women-specific roles”. These kinds of stress among males can lead to increased levels of domestic violence, placing more women at risk. The GBV Information Management System (IMS) recorded 8,031 incidents between January and September 2016, 64 per cent of which were cases of emotional or psychological abuse (3,373 cases) or physical assault (1,767 cases). However, the true extent is certainly far greater in light of social norms that discourage reporting",9

In neighboring Kapoeta East, key informants report food security has also deteriorated. The driver of this deterioration is conflict, specifically cattle raiding. The dominate livelihood system in these counties is pastoralism, and according to the December 2017 FSNMS, 60-80 percent of households have experienced a significant decrease in livestock herd sizes (Figure 1). In interviews conducted by REACH, some households reported an increase in cattle raiding among neighbors, a breakdown of typical kinship that likely indicates increased levels of extreme coping. In addition, trade flows and humanitarian access remain minimal due to continued road ambushes and lootings. In Pibor, conflict forced humanitarian agencies to relocate to Pibor town from Gumuruk and Lekwangole payams in July 2017.

Protection violations, notably GBV related, remain underreported due to cultural norms and possible social stigmatisation of survivors. ? Insufficient presence of authorities in IDP sites to ensure security – however, armed actors are potential GBV perpetrators. Additionally, there is a lack of access to justice for GBV survivors in areas of the country, notably Gedo. ? Security of tenure for new arrivals is limited, increasing the risk of eviction and resulting destruction of humanitarian investments; protracted IDPs are at risk of eviction due to assistance focusing on newly displaced families. ? Military withdrawals expose populations to reprisals, while humanitarian actors might have responded to needs in newly captured areas",9
1917,"December saw a considerable increase in the national average retail price of white maize (10.3%) relative to November. In Gorongoza, a prime maize market in Mozambique, prices fell for the first time since April 2016 in November 2016 (down 7.1% relative to October 2016). However, prices picked up again in December 2016 (up 6.8%) reversing most of the gains from November (Figure 6). Prices remain at ALPS Crisis mode and stand 198% above its November 5 year average. To note, inflation went from about 26.8% in November to about 25% in December (a 6.7% decline) and the currency appreciated by 4.4%against the US dollar. Thus, the upward pressure on prices in December is likely due to the fact that the region is nearing the peak of the lean season.",3

The blockade shut down three out of four railway crossing points, with the combined capacity of 9 million tons of coal transported per year (see the infographic). The blockade primarily affects the delivery of anthracite coal from NGCA to GCA, which is used by the thermal power plants (TPPs) in Ukraine to produce electricity. TPPs account for one third of all electricity produced in Ukraine, and about 40 per cent of the coal consumed by TPPs is produced in NGCA of Donetska oblast. To avert an energy crisis, the Government of Ukraine (GOU) declared a state of emergency in the energy market, planned to last from 15 February to 17 March. The temporary emergency measures may be prolonged and potentially include rolling power blackouts. To compensate for the coal shortage, Ukraine has increased the share of nuclear energy in the overall energy balance of the country – from 47 per cent to almost 60 per cent. Yet, it would cost US$550 million to stop using coal from the Donbas and would put an additional burden of approximately US$40 million in unemployment allowance to thousands of potentially affected people.

Among the worst-hit crops are paddy (summer rice), jute (vegetable fibre), dhaincha (multipurpose legume) and vegetables, with around 611,170 hectares of standing crops in 32 districts4 have suffered damages. The damage to agriculture will likely have an impact on the availability and price of food at the local markets as well as the demand for labour over the next months. Lesser work opportunities will reduce the purchasing power of vulnerable households, which will in turn result in a prolonged lean season and negatively affect food security and nutrition status. Another concern linked to agriculture is replanting the Aman crop, especially because seedbeds have been damaged. In addition, the flood situation is making it difficult for farmers to cultivate land as most embankments have been washed away. The floods have also affected availability of fodder for livestock, such as cattle, and reduced safe and secure places for the livestock, increasing the likelihood of cattle mortality. If the situation persists, the affected people are likely to resort to negative coping means such as taking loans or selling their poultry and livestock to obtain money for survival – a situation which leaves them economically vulnerable. Already, many farmers – who traditionally  rear cows and goats to sell during the Eid Ul Adha festival – fear that they may not be able to sell their livestock as expected and have resorted to immediate disposing them off at a lower market value.

There was only an exchange of fire between the regime forces and the factions in addition to the dropping of a number of shells at midnight yesterday. The first hour of the implementation of the agreement which was put into effect at 12 pm on June 17, also witnessed the dropping of a number of shells by the regime forces on areas in Daraa Al-Balad and a number of raids by the warplanes targeting areas in the vicinity of Daraa Camp and areas in Daraa city.  This prevailing calm came as a result of the agreement after the city had witnessed the fiercest battles since the implementation of the “de-escalation zones” agreement on the 6th of May 2017 between the regime forces, their allied militiamen and Lebanese Hezbollah on one hand and the rebel and Islamic factions and fighters of Hayyaat Tahrir Al-Sham on the other in areas in Daraa al-Balad and in the vicinity of Daraa camp from the 3rd till the afternoon of the 17th of June 2017.

However, due to the high cost of living in Gaziantep and Kilis and lack of support, many will settle for cramped and derelict housing. Common obstacles to finding suitable shelter include high rental costs, language barriers, and unemployment. Those who feel that employment is hard to find do so primarily because of language barriers, a lack of opportunities that they feel qualified for, and a lack of official documentation, such as work permits. Moreover, work is often informal, leaving many vulnerable to exploitation through low wages and long hours. Hence, despite the optimism around finding work and housing, respondents make frequent requests for help in finding suitable and affordable shelter and accessing further livelihood support",5

Consequently, in January, breeders usually choose transhumance as a way to ensure their livestock’s survival. The trip weakens the physical condition of livestock and contributes to heighten inter community tensions around natural resources management on the routes. Apart from transhumance, another coping strategy for breeders is to grow their own fodder, and store it in prevision for the hunger gap, in order to sustain livestock’s body condition. However, the price of bourgou (main fodder used in the targeted regions) has nearly doubled in Gao and Menaka since 2017, and has now become too expensive to represent a fair alternative to transhumance.

31461,"This situation follows a very bad 2017-2018 agro-pastoral season arising from severe drought. A significant rainfall deficit (less than 32 percent compared to 20162 ) as well as a poor spatial-temporal distribution of rains have had disastrous consequences on agriculture and livestock, mainly affecting the vulnerable agro-pastoralists of southern Mauritania. This had an impact on all the wilayas (provinces) particularly during the months of July, August and September, which normally constitute the rainiest period favouring the development of the herbaceous carpet and seedling success. The early arrival of the rains in June which then ceased throughout the month of July, led to the failure of planting, the disappearance of grass and, in most areas3 , the drying up of soils. The main consequences for agriculture and livestock are: • Agricultural productions 4 for the year 2017-2018 is down by three percent compared to the 2016-2017 crop year and 11 percent above the average of the last five years (gross production of 298,265 tonnes all speculations combined against 333,936 tonnes for the average of the last five years and 306,448 tonnes in 2016-2017); • Pastures are highly affected by this deficit. The biomass production is currently below the historical average for most wilayas, and at times their production is comparable or worse than that of 20115 . As a result, the transhumance of herds started early this year with significant movements of livestock registered in October in the interior of the country, from the north to the southern refuge areas and outside, close to the neighbouring countries. Added to this are the watering difficulties due to the scarcity of surface water and the rapid drying up of wells.",0

No confirmed cases have been reported since 6 November and, to date, no cases of plague have been reported outside of Madagascar. While the number of new cases and hospitalizations are declining, evidence suggests that the epidemic phase of the outbreak is ending. However, WHO anticipates plague cases to be reported until the endemic plague season ends in April 2018. Based on available information and response measures implemented to date, the potential risk of further spread of plague at national level remains high. The risk of international spread is mitigated by the short incubation period of pneumonic plague, implementation of exit screening measures and advice to travellers to Madagascar, and scaling up of preparedness and operational readiness activities in neighbouring Indian Ocean islands and other southern and east African countries.

Thet Kay Pyin is home to 8,797 of the 101,547 people living in 15 camps or with host families in Sittwe Township out of a total IDP population in Rakhine of 127,574, showed figures released in March. Coastal Rakhine is at risk from tropical cyclones, earthquakes, floods and tsunamis. Last year, destructive winds and rain from Cyclone Mora reached 12 out of 17 townships in the state. Roads, houses, schools and religious buildings were destroyed, but IDP camps suffered the worst damage. Thousands were left without shelter or potable water. ",1
21511,"S ituat ion Overv iew   On 26 February 2018, a 7.5 magnitude earthquake hit the Highlands Region of Papua New Guinea (PNG), affecting an estimated 544,000 people in five provinces – Enga, Gulf, Hela, Southern Highlands and Western provinces, with Hela and Southern Highlands the most affected. More than 270,000 people, including 125,000 children, have been left in immediate need of life-saving assistance. Since the initial 26 February earthquake, at least 195 aftershocks have occurred, of which six were of a 6.0 or greater magnitude.   The latest tracking figures available from the Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) implemented as part of the Shelter Cluster response, indicate that 11,041 households (42,577 people) remain displaced due to the earthquake, of which 1,252 households (24 per cent) are displaced in nine care centres while 9,789 households remain within their communities. The number of people registered as staying in care centres continues to fluctuate, and the overall number of displaced may rise as new assessments are carried out .   The Shelter Cluster has adopted common definitions of settlement types defining a care centre as a displacement site where people are hosted away from their community or area of origin , and affected community as a community where people are still living within their community, even if displaced locally from their damaged/destroyed home. Two shelter response options and recommended packages have been proposed for cluster members’   + For more information, see “background on the crisis” at the end of the report   https://www.humanitarianresponse.info/en/operations/papua-new-guinea   PNG Disaster Management Team    Papua New Guinea - Highlands Earthquake Situation Report No. 8 | 2   endorsement corresponding to the two target groups defined above: (1) IDP household Shelter-NFI return kit (for those in care centres); and (2) community reconstruction toolkit (for affected communities). The Food Security Cluster advises that affected households still living in their communities and thereby having access to land should also be supported with agriculture and other recovery kits, and that this could help promote return of other displaced people.   More than 80 per cent of health facilities in Hela and Southern Highlands (69 of 86) are open and functional, but 13 of these health facilities sustained severe structural damage that continues to pose serious occupational threats to all users. Refurbishment of earthquake related structural damages remains a challenge. In particular, 55 per cent of health facilities urgently need access to safe water sources.   Traditional water sources were destroyed by earthquake-induced landslides and landslips. Water quality testing is already underway, with capacity to sample and test water in sources suspected to be contaminated established in Southern Highlands province. The Health Cluster reports that the results of the water testing of the Kikori River in Gulf province showed no heavy metal contamination. However, bacteriological analysis showed heavy coliform presence which may result in water -borne diseases. The lack of access to safe drinking water significantly increases risks of water-borne diseases outbreak among affected and displaced persons. Gastrointestinal and diarrheal diseases due to poor water and sanitation are increasing , with a cumulative total of 181 cases reported from nine health facilities in Hela and Southern Highlands provinces.   A mass vaccination campaign is scheduled to begin at the end of April covering all children under five years of age in five districts of Southern Highlands Province: Lalibu Pangia, Imboggu, Kagua Erave, Mendi Munihu, and Nipa Kutubu.   Nutrition service provision has started at Mendi General Hospital, Urila Poroma Care Center, Tamenda Health Sub centre and Pimaga Rural in Southern Highlands province, with 62 children screened for Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) of which two were hospitalized. A total of 1,240 children are targeted to receive treatment for Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM). To date, 14 community health workers and 13 nurses, nutritionists, and medical officers (out of 120 targeted for training) have been oriented in SAM management.   Since 28 March, most humanitarian programmes in and around Tari, the provincial capital of Hela province, have been suspended due to increased tension and inter-communal fighting. Many partners have temporarily relocated humanitarian staff to other locations, including to the Southern Highlands provincial capital, Mendi, in view of the situation. Humanitarian partners aim to resume relief work as soon as the security situation allows. While the situation seemed to calm for a period, tensions were reportedly rising again since 19 April. ",1

There is a water system near the clinic which needs rehabilitation. Currently there is an elevated stand which could hoist an elevated tank. The borehole seems intact and would need solar panel installation as well as borehole flashing as well as refurbishment of the system. 4. There are 4 broken boreholes in the vicinity of Nhialdiu.

Amongst the children skin disease and respiratory infections as well as AWD cases were rampant with no cure or awareness of how to prevent the diseases, especially since there were no outreach medical services. 9. Lack of soap was attributed to the poor hygiene practices. Beneficiaries mentioned that they have not received soap as well it is not available in the market. 10. The community mentioned lack of water was a big challenge since the farthest village was at least 4 hours walk while there was in adequate water storage and transport facilities. 11. There was wide spread open defecation since there is a lot of bushy areas. There was no single household which had latrines. In the school which was visited during the assessment, some of theclassrooms have been turned into OD locations with people defecating on the concrete floor. Diarrhea feces were also observed in the classrooms with high cases of flies which is a high risk for the community. 12. There is a group of pump mechanics in Nhialdiu, but only one is remaining.

15975,"In Niger, the food security situation has remained difficult in several parts of the country due to the lingering effects of the previous food crises and the impact of recent years’ of erratic rains leading crops and pastures deficits in some regions. In 2017 dry matter stocks is getting scarce. Global balance deficit calculated by authorities is over 12 million tons, about 48% of the theoretical overall requirements estimated at 25.6 million tons (PREGEC, March 2017). This represents 4 to 5 months of consumption on the 9 month. Additionally, the drying up of several ponds and water points endangers livestock production in some areas. The availability of cereals remains varied in the markets followed, either because of the isolation of the locality or the bad state of the roads (Agadez, north of Diffa and Tahoua), the security situation (north Tllaberi and Bosso) or the deficit Of production recorded this year (Abala, Guidan Roumdji, Loga, Ouallam, Mayahi). The Niger is highly dependent on imports of coarse grains (millet, sorghum and maize) from its neighbours, Benin and Nigeria, to cover its cereal requirements. The strong demand from institutional bodies for the replenishment of their stocks have also put pressure on cereal prices in recent months. (FAO) The upward trend in cereal prices bases is due to: ? A launch of the marketing period with intense levels of trade due to the early influx of traders and households rebuilding their stock; ? A decrease in local supply caused by production deficits in areas of usually high yields such as the departments of Mayahi, Guidan Roumdji and North Dakoro in the Maradi region, which resulted in a reversal of internal trade flows; ? A potential effect due to the launch of the government's 30,000-tonne national tenders for the replenishment of the National Security Stock in November 2016 (Cf: Bulletin Albichir de N°85); ? Non-official export restrictions along the Nigerian border; ? The economic situation (continued depreciation of the naira, rise in prices at source), with a consequent reduction in incentives for Niger traders to import from Nigerian markets; The price of millet is up compared to the same period of 2016 and average of the last five years. This increase, beyond its seasonal pattern, is atypical as it is starting early in the year and reaches levels above the 5 year average as soon as March 2017. ( See below)",3

Severe food insecurity is affecting the population as a whole, with internally displaced persons (IDPs) being the most vulnerable. Persistent insecurity and armed conflict have disrupted livelihood activities, affected market functionality and limited physical access to markets. In particular, the widespread conflict has brought nearly 2 million people to seek refuge in neighbouring countries. The worsening economic crises have resulted in high food prices, local currency devaluation and hyperinflation, which in turn eroded household purchasing power. In addition, an anticipated earlier-than-normal start of the lean season in many areas will further hamper people’s food security, impairing the very survival of the most vulnerable. Acute malnutrition has worsened compared to the same period in 2016 and remains high in many parts of South Sudan. ACTIONS NEEDED FAMINE MONITORING Even though no county is classified in Famine (IPC Phase 5) in this IPC update, there are still people facing humanitarian catastrophe in the counties most affected by the conflict and insecurity. In the worst case scenario, given the severity of the food security and nutrition situation observed during the 2017 lean season, continued conflict, humanitarian access constraints, climatic shocks and macro-economic instability leading up to the 2018 lean season will likely result in Famine (IPC Phase 5) conditions in multiple locations across South Sudan.",3

UNICEF response To date, UNICEF has delivered 23 metric tons of life-saving supplies including tents and tarpaulins, water purification tablets, hygiene kits, and learning kits. A few days after the earthquakes, UNICEF distributed vaccines to the affected communities to protect some 31,700 children against measles and rubella, pertussis, pneumonia and tuberculosis.   Currently, UNICEF is working to save lives and protect the well-being of affected children and families by making sure that:  - Children receive the emergency therapeutic food and milk they need to survive,  Basic health services, including vaccines (jointly with WHO, Government churches), reach children in affected communities - Children have safe water to drink - Children receive psychosocial support in safe child friendly spaces.  Yet despite progress, providing assistance continues to be very challenging.  Many earthquake-hit communities are very hard to reach, with little or no road access. Insecurity and tribal fighting in the worst-hit areas also hinders humanitarian response.  Efforts to protect vulnerable children need to be stepped up and sustained.

2723,"February to May 2018: Through mid-March, during the dry season, deteriorations in food security are expected in pastoral areas as forage and water resources worsen, negatively impacting livestock prices and milk production, in turn reducing household incomes and food access. In the marginal areas, food availability and consumption will be improved by the belowaverage long rains harvests that will support food consumption for one to two months, up to April. In areas where belowaverage March – May long rains are forecasted, short-lived improvements are expected to temporarily improve household income and food availability. Staple food prices are expected to decline with the harvests in February, facilitating better market access, but then will quickly rise in March. Household incomes are expected to improve from mid-March in the marginal agricultural areas with the kick-off of planting activities and from mid-April in the pastoral areas as the forage-driven livestock body conditions improve, increasing livestock productivity. Depending on the availability of household food stocks from the February harvest and rainfall-driven casual labor opportunities, Minimal (IPC Phase 1) outcomes are expected in some marginal agricultural areas, including parts of Taita Taveta, Kwale, Kilifi, Meru, Tharaka Nithi, Makueni, and Embu; agropastoral areas of Laikipia, Baringo, West Pokot, and Narok; as well as the high and medium-producing areas. Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes are likely to persist in the rest of the marginal agricultural areas as poor households are able to meet their minimum food needs but are forgoing their essential non-food needs, following their constrained purchasing power and early depleted household stocks. Increased incomes in pastoral areas, where income had been previously below average, from livestock productivity and sales, are expected by late April. In these areas, it is expected that poor households will be dependent on casual labor, petty trade, charcoal and firewood sales, and remittances to bridge their income gaps, keeping the majority in Stressed (IPC Phase 2) acute food insecurity. However, for areas that will experience their second or third consecutive poor performing seasons, Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are likely to persist through April in most of Isiolo and Garissa, and parts of Tana River, Mandera, Samburu, Wajir, Kajiado, and Marsabit.

28204,"Displacement and destruction of homes and infrastructure have caused significant shelter needs in north-east Nigeria. Key sectoral vulnerabilities and shelter assessments reveal that more than 2.1 million people will require shelter and non-food items (NFIs) assistance in 2018. This includes 1.6 million IDPs, 265,000 people living in host communities, and 270,000 returnees in need of shelter and NFI support. Overall, 55 per cent of the people in need are women and girls. Shelter needs patterns have shifted since the beginning of the crisis, in line with various waves of displacement, new arrivals and returns. The vast majority of the people (86 per cent) fled their homes before 2016, though ongoing military operations and attacks are also continuing to cause fresh displacements particularly with people arriving from inaccessible areas. Over one third of affected people are currently living in emergency family shelters, while another third lives in self-made or makeshift shelters. About 23 per cent of IDPs live in collective shelters (such as schools, government buildings, community centres, etc.) The transitional needs of returnees, though shaped by very different dynamics, are also significant. Out of the 1.3 million people assessed in returns area, the majority returned three years ago (in 2014), while 11 per cent returned in 2015, 8 per cent in 2016, and 5 per cent in 2017. Nearly one quarter of returnees assessed in return areas (nearly 50,000 households) live in inadequate shelters, with 86 per cent (40,000 households) of these in partially damaged housing. A lack of capital to purchase building materials undermines opportunities for stimulating early recovery in areas of return. NFIs remain the second most reported need of affected people in north-east Nigeria, both in host communities and in camp or camplike settings, where the provisions of NFIs has not been systematic for new arrivals due to the lack of prepositioned items in key receiving areas. The three main NFIs requested by the affected people are mats (41 per cent), mosquito nets (29 per cent), and kitchen sets (20 per cent). While over 70,000 households benefitted from NFI assistance in the past year, significant needs remain, in part due to continuous population movements and the short lifespan of shelter-related NFIs, which implies a constant need for replenishment.",10

Although humanitarian access remains volatile in many areas of the country, humanitarian actors currently report ability to regularly access Panyijiar and Mayendit. It is therefore expected that large-scale humanitarian assistance is likely to continue through at least May. Mayendit is expected to remain in Emergency (IPC Phase 4!) and Panyijiar is likely to remain in Crisis (IPC Phase 3!). From June to September, in the absence of continued assistance, Panyijiar is likely to be in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) and Mayendit would likely be in Famine (IPC Phase 5).

12967,"Food prices showed mixed trends in January but still generally high Wholesale prices of maize generally strengthened in January, while those of millet and sorghum remained relatively stable or weakened in some markets. Price of white gari (made from cassava) and rice showed mixed trends. Prices were generally below their year-earlier values following the good 2017 harvests, but still relatively high, particularly in the northeastern parts of the country, where the ongoing conflict continues to hinder food production activities and disrupt markets. In general, the high level of food prices in the country reflects the lingering effects of the reduced value of the local currency against the US dollar, which underpinned prices in the past several months. Increased fuel and transport costs, coupled with demand from neighbouring countries, also supported prices. More recently, traders’ purchases to replenish their stocks contributed to limit the downward pressure from the good harvest and to keep prices at high levels. Despite some improvement in the economy of the country, which reflects in the year-on-year general inflation continuing to fall, the annual food inflation in January remained at the high level of 18.9 percent, only slightly down from the 19.4 percent in December 2017.",3

This is in the same ballpark as last year, though the WHO figures also suggest that India is unlikely to reduce its case burden beyond 40% by 2020. In contrast, Maldives, Sri Lanka and Kyrgyzstan achieved malaria-free status in 2015 and 2016 respectively. There were an estimated 445,000 deaths from malaria globally in 2016, compared with 446,000 estimated deaths in 2015. About 80% of the deaths were accounted for by 15 countries, namely, India and 14 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.   A key impediment to eliminating malaria is a weak surveillance system. India and Nigeria, two major contributors to the global burden of malaria, were able to detect only 8% and 16% of cases, respectively, via the system.  Moreover, 51% of plasmodium vivax cases — the milder cousin of the p. falciparum — were traced in India. This could at least be partially explained by resistance to chloroquine, the first line treatment to p. vivax infections that has been detected in pockets of the country earlier this decade. For a long time, p falciparum dominated India’s case burden and, though its share has decreased, there is a slight increase in malaria cases by other parasites.  Bhutan, Nepal, Thailand, Bangladesh, Myanmar and Indonesia, says the WHO, are among the countries poised to reduce malaria incidence by over 40% by 2020. India — due to low funding per person at risk and resistance to certain frontline insecticides — is only expected to achieve a 20%-40% reduction.  In 2016, an estimated ?13,000 crore was invested in malaria control and elimination efforts globally by governments of malaria endemic countries and their international partners. The majority (74%) of investments in 2016 were spent in the WHO’s Africa region, followed by the WHO regions of Southeast Asia (7%), the Eastern Mediterranean and the Americas (each 6%), and the Western Pacific (4%).",4

Limited crop production in the northeast suggests that the affected households and IDPs will remain dependent on purchasing food from markets while at the same time having reduced purchasing power due to high food prices. Food prices are expected to increase further towards the lean season in June. ³ The food security situation is projected to deteriorate into 2017.

28139,"he logistics of preparing for cyclones and a heavy monsoon season are daunting in the densely packed camps: reinforcing muddy roads, sandbagging, and levelling unstable areas, pre-positioning supplies, formulating evacuation routes, finding sturdy emergency shelters, and even communicating all of this to refugees in a frantic environment where language barriers have been a problem.  'You talk to anybody here and most people are worried that we have a very, very small window now in the dry season,' said Shelley Thakral, a spokeswoman for the World Food Programme.  WFP engineers have built a bridge in a part of the camp and are working on ways to make sure aid groups can still deliver supplies when the monsoon rains come. But the crowded landscape is formidable, from tents clustered on floodplains to homes carved into the slopes.  'It's tiered housing. People have cut themselves into the sides of hills,' said Thakral. 'The earth is very porous; you just sink in it. It's impassable.'   A powerful cyclone could demolish the muddy footpaths that connect the most isolated shelters in the sprawling camps, but it could also cut off agencies based in the resort town of Cox’s Bazar from the 40-km stretch of road along which most of the settlements are scattered.  Local NGOs have set up bases closer to the camps and the WFP has a central logistics hub where a refrigerated container and 16 mobile units will be stocked with supplies. Smaller containers could be brought in to the refugee sites – though where exactly they would fit in the teeming camps is uncertain.  This speaks to the central problem posed by the land itself: there’s not enough space in the crowded camps.  Eastmond told IRIN that a viable evacuation plan for the Rohingya refugees is a priority. Yet existing cyclone shelters built for the local population in the surrounding sub-districts are already overwhelmed.  His team is exploring plans to either ask longer-term refugees with more stable shelters to take in new arrivals, or to evacuate refugees into more permanent structures like schools and mosques. But it is unclear whether there are enough to hold the sheer numbers who would need shelter.  'The problem with relocation is the fundamental problem we have with the whole response, which is that we don't have land,' he said.   ‘Everything came down’Cyclone Mora is still fresh on the minds of Rohingya who were already living here, pushed out by previous waves of violence in Myanmar’s Rakhine State.  Nur Asha’s home has mud walls, offering more stability than the bamboo and tarpaulin tents many of the newest refugees have built. But it wasn’t strong enough for Cyclone Mora.  'My home was destroyed. Everything came down,” she said.  Salim Shaheen was born in the camps after his parents fled Myanmar in the 1990s. He told IRIN that people took shelter in nearby schools and madrassas when Cyclone Mora hit, but there wasn’t enough room for everyone.  Now, there’s even less space. Sunjuddin, a newer arrival who fled his village in late August, told IRIN he’s certain a strong storm would knock over his home — a tarpaulin roof latched onto bamboo poles.  'I didn't build my home sturdily, so if a cyclone comes, it will be destroyed,' he said. “There’s no way I can stay in that hut.”",10

23278,"The food security situation in Deir-ez-Zor city notably deteriorated during the siege period (December 2014 till September 2017) where ISIL surrounded the city and cut all supply routes into and out of the city. At the start of 2016, the situation reached alarming levels where reportedly wild foods and water became the only food for many households on a daily basis. In April 2016 WFP commenced food aid airdrops which become the main source of food for almost all households in the besieged area. Following the end of the siege on 17 September 2017, food accessibility remarkably improved among residents in Deir-ez-Zor city in-line with better functionality of supply routes, enhanced commercial flow to the city and increased food availability in markets, hereby reducing food prices. Mortality among new born babies and severe malnutrition cases among pregnant women and children due to lack of food, are reported to have significantly decreased compared to siege levels and many households reported access to better diets. However, the majority of the population are still unable to consume more than two meals per day. The majority of the population were reported to largely depend on starch foods such as (bread, bulgur, potato and rice) and pulses (lentil and white beans) as their daily diet, while access to fresh foods (fruits, vegetables and milk/dairy products) and meat was identified to be low by many interviewed households due to their high prices which not everyone can afford. This was also confirmed by local key informants and interviewed doctors in medical centres who reported many cases of night blindness among children, an indication of likely vitamin A deficiency. Many residents reported to have exhausted all their assets during the siege and many returnees have lost their house, income and assets during years of displacement. Among the large in need population in Deir-ez-Zor city, the population residing in the Harabish neighbourhood was reported to be the worst-off. Malnutrition cases among residents and IDPs in this neighbourhood were documented to be higher than those of returnees as the residents struggled against severe shortage of food during the siege and need longerterm support to recover. On the other hand, due to the high level of devastation in Deir-ez-Zor city, increased number of returnees and high demand on accommodation has caused rent to become very expensive as it is the only option for many returnees. As a result, the majority of returnees’ expenditure was reportedly spent on rent leaving them with little money with which to buy food. In some cases, returnees were reported to be either living in open spaces or in partially destroyed buildings under poor living conditions, putting further pressure on their food security situation especially for poor vulnerable and female households. @Um Taha: ”We returned to Deir-ez-Zor three weeks ago, we live here and we dry this bread to consume it whenever we don’t have enough food”. Food assistance and buying food from markets was reported to be the main food sources in the city while local agriculture and livestock production which used to be the main food source to the city from rural areas of Deir-ez-Zor before 2014 are now minimal and inaccessible.

This figure is a preliminary estimate by a joint inter-agency assessment comprising government ministries, UN agencies and international NGOs that visited the area. Emergency shelter, non-food items (ES/NFIs), food and access to water and sanitation services are the priority needs of these new IDPs, according to the joint inter-agency team’s preliminary findings. ES/NFIs: The new IDPs arrived with few personal belongings and are sheltering under trees. Water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH): There is one water pump in Jemeza village, which has been repaired by the inter-agency team, which also brought some WASH materials with them. However, due to the large number of displaced, the amount of water available is below SPHERE standards.  Health and nutrition: There is no health facility in Jemeza village and the nearest health facility where IDPs can access health and nutrition services is in Rokero town. The health facility is run by the State Ministry of Health (SMoH) with support from Catholic Relief Services (CRS) and World Relief (WR). Currently, half rations of the 800 cartons of plumpy nut (nutrition supplement) available in the facility is being distributed to children under five. Nutrition screening is also being undertaken.  Education: The estimated new IDP population includes about 1,150 school-age children, who are currently out of school due to lack of education facilities in the area.  Child protection: Three children were reported missing during interviews with the displaced community.  Food security and livelihoods: There are no food supplies in the local market, and the World Food Programme (WFP) sent food supplies to Rokero on 29 April and initial food distribution for the new IDPs is scheduled for 30 April.",11

33298,"Liquidity crisis, commodity shortages, and rising prices Conflict, severe economic decline and imposed restrictions are all contributing to basic commodity shortages and price rises, making it difficult for millions of Yemenis to afford food, water, fuel and other necessities even when these are available in markets. For months, nearly all basic commodities have been only sporadically available in most locations, and basic commodity prices in August were on average 26 per cent higher than before the crisis. The impact of price increases on Yemeni families is considerable, given that purchasing power has fallen substantially as livelihoods opportunities continue to diminish or disappear. At the same time, Yemen is experiencing a severe liquidity crisis in which people, traders and humanitarian partners struggle to transfer cash into and around the country. As conflict and import restrictions have persisted, lenders have become increasingly reluctant to offer letters of credit to Yemeni traders. This reluctance has reportedly grown since the Government’s decision in September to relocate the Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) from Sana’a to Aden. These developments are having a pronounced impact on the ability to finance imports of food, medicine, and other critical supplies, compounding the effect of direct import restrictions, as well as considerably restricting people’s ability to access cash. Despite the liquidity crisis, minimal banking services remain available in many areas. Probably the three most common institutions for domestic cash transfers – Yemen Post Office, Al Amal Bank and Al Kuraimi Bank – report a combined total of 894 active branches or authorized agents across all governorates, although 24 per cent of post offices are not functioning. When considered with at least sporadic commodity availability in markets, this raises the possibility of a stronger need for multisector cash assistance to help Yemenis cope in a time of conflict, economic decline and institutional collapse. More analysis is required on this issue, particularly regarding how to ensure the proper enabling environment, minimize protection risks, and overcome external and internal limitations on financial transactions. As of October 2015, humanitarian partners in Sana’a reportedly cannot withdraw more than YR 400,000 in cash per day from banks (about $1,300); in Al Hudaydah, the limit falls to YR 200,000. ",1

In the 200 hectares in the north, where farmers had prepared, the damage was minor to moderate. However, in central and southern Gaza, some 200 hectares of farmland sustained heavy damage, both because farmers were not given a chance to prepare for the spraying and because most of the crops grown in this area are leafy and more sensitive to the chemicals used by the military.

Since the beginning of 2017, close to 2,400 cases have been reported in the province. Health actors are responding to the epidemic but the main challenge remains in the preventive activities. South Kivu’s official declaration came a few days after its northern sister, North Kivu, was also declared in epidemic. In Tanganyika, the situation of cholera could worsen in the coming weeks mostly due to unoperational chlorination points in a number of areas, the dysfunctioning of the nationaly water supply company and the ongoing population movement. The lack of actors and means to strengthen case prevention is another obstacle to an efficient response. In the western province of Kwilu, 16 of some 100 people who have contracted the disease died of the water-borne disease between 14-18 August. Kwilu’s Governor deplored that the province does not have a hospital complex specialized in the treatment of cholera.

As a result, agricultural land requiring costly irrigation may be planted with crops requiring less irrigation, which are normally significantly less profitable. Such a shift would not only drastically reduce farmers’ incomes, but would also limit the quality and quantity of agricultural products (plant and animal) available in the Gaza Strip. This could lead to price increases and restricted access by vulnerable groups to items needed to meet basic dietary needs unless protective measures are put in place.

14297,"The 32 percent increase in agricultural production, relative to the average, favors satisfactory household and market availability of food despite pockets of production deficits in some parts of the country. As a result, most households in the country are currently in a situation of Minimal (IPC Phase 1) food insecurity. The early deterioration of localized pastoral conditions in the pastoral zones of the northern and western Sahel regions has resulted in unusual movements of livestock. The decline in production and livestock body conditions compared to average will affect incomes of pastoralist households; which will limit their ability to access markets. Household access to cereals is generally average in agricultural areas thanks to the availability of own production, payments in kind, and donations, which reduce households’ dependence on markets. However, above-average price increases in consumption areas, as well as declining goat/millet terms of trade are not conducive to adequate access of poor households to markets. Poor households in the Goundam Lakes area, the Niger Delta, parts of the Western Sahel, and Gourma of Gao and Timbuktu, who will deplete stocks earlier than usual and will need to purchase in markets with high grain prices, will experience an early lean season. As a result, they will experience Stressed (IPC Phase 2) food insecurity outcomes from March until the end of the lean season in September 2018.",3

1504,"In brief the assessment found extensive and continuing need for humanitarian assistance in the each of the communities visited during the assessment. In three of the communities visited namely Huiya, Dodomona and Walagu the scale of need is significant with the majority of householders in each community displaced and continuing to be severely affected by the effects of the earthquake that struck on the 26th February 2018.  The number one priority need is for shelter. Families need to move on with their lives, settle in new locations for the most part or return to previous areas, move out of care centres and communal shelters to individual family homes that provide shelter from the elements, reduce their risk to communicable disease and afford them the dignity and privacy they require. Part of the rebuilding process is the re-establishment of gardens for the cultivation of food crops to sustain their lives into the future and wean off the food aid support that will shortly come to an end.  Health and WaSH are perhaps jointly second priorities. The background incidence of communicable diseases such as diarrhoea, skin infections and respiratory diseases is high with elevated levels reported since the earthquake struck. Investment in prevention through support in water, sanitation and hygiene is vitally important at this time. Immediate requirements are to provide WaSH related NFIs such as jerrycans and soap coupled with education and promotion to support good hygiene practices such as handwashing with soapat critical times. Longer term support can be provided to improve access to water of a potable quality, that is accessible and of a quality fit for a range of different purposes.  Health Care is deficient is a number of areas not only to address the communicable disease burden but address the many other health issues that affect the targeted communities. Issues such as injuries, vaccination, reproductive health, STIs and other infections such as TB are high priority issues to be supported within the health system. The local health infrastructure is clearly lacking in many areas such as physical infrastructure, equipment, consistent and comprehensive drugs supply as well as staffing.  As mentioned under Shelter people want to re-establish their gardens for the cultivation of food. Significant challenges exist regarding the staple food crop Sago which has been lost under many landslides and can’t be replaced easily. Other needs include a range of seeds and tools to support the re-establishment of gardens. Linked to this is the issue of nutrition as chronic nutrition is apparent in the communities. There is an opportunity to support communities build more protein and micronutrients into their existing diet through the livelihoods support to be provided.  Like the Aid Posts other community infrastructure was insufficient even before the damage caused by the earthquake. Another opportunity exists to support Schools in particular and raise the quality of infrastructure by investing in Rain Water Harvesting and other WaSH infrastructure such as toilets and handwashing facilities to support the education needs of school going children.Protection and Gender issues exist in the communities viewed but were not reported to be at levels above those before the earthquake. The isolated feature of these communities and the observed sharing of tasks between men and women suggests protection and gender issues are not as big an issue as could have been anticipated.  However, the big proviso is that protection issues often go unseen and are confined to the domestic sphere. Further, it is well documented that disaster and displacement result in increased protection and gender risks and so it is recommended that these risks be subject to ongoing monitoring supported by an integrated education and training program with defined, but realistic, avenues for assistance and support where needed.  Lastly, the assessment also looked to see ways in which Disaster Risk Management could be enhanced through the recovery programme. Much of the infrastructure, training and health/hygiene promotion support will incorporate ways to build the resilience of these communities to future shocks such as earthquakes, floods and drought. Wider work may be needed to connect communities to broader Disaster Risk Management.  In short there is real need in these communities and CARE is well placed to deliver multi sectoral support in coordination with key stakeholders within Government and other service providers in the NGO and wider humanitarian response community.",1

Due to Hurricane Matthew, the number of suspected cholera cases increased from 2,236 (registered between 4 September and 1 October) to 6,096 cases (registered between 4 October and 9 November). About half of these new cases nationwide were reported in Grand’Anse and Sud departments16. Before the hurricane this proportion was only 8 per cent. However, a cholera vaccination campaign held in November reduced transmission in Grand’Anse and Sud departments, and, as of November, the nationwide severe cholera upsurge feared after Matthew, had not occurred.   Still, cholera will remain a serious threat for the most vulnerable Haitians in 2017 as Haiti accounts for 13 per cent of registered cholera deaths worldwide. Haiti also still belongs to the group of 12 countries with a case fatality rate between 1 and 5 per cent. While the number of cholera cases and deaths has decreased since the 2010 outbreak, 35,203 cases and 369 deaths were registered from January to October 2016. This represents a 32 and 56 per cent increase, respectively, in comparison to the same period in 2015. Ouest, Centre, Artibonite and Nord departments remained the most affected in 2016. People’s low access to safe water and sanitation keeps them highly vulnerable to cholera; national capacity also remains weak to deal with the epidemic on its own. With 20 communes in red alert18 , cholera control requires a reinforced and sustained capacity to respond to each alert throughout the country. In 2017, cholera is likely to affect 30,000 people developing the disease, and 1.65 million people19 indirectly affected requiring immediate community response through the “cordon sanitaire” during reported outbreaks.

She was admitted to a health facility the same day and was transferred to a private clinic 8 days later after no improvement in symptoms. She was treated at the clinic for malaria and typhoid fever over 4 days and died at home on 19 December 2017 after her symptoms worsened.

However, Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes are present in parts of Sofala, Manica, and Tete provinces. As the lean season progresses, there is an expected deterioration to Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes in northwestern Sofala until the harvest in mid-April. Poor households in these areas are expected to require humanitarian assistance to cover their food gaps. Food access remains favorable across the country as the bumper crop production is directly reflected in lower staple food prices. Atypical, stable maize grain prices continued in August, September, and October at below five-year averages. According to FEWS NET price projections, this trend is likely to continue through at least May 2018. As poor households continue to restore previously depleted incomes throughout the 2017/18 agricultural season, these lower staple food prices are expected to ease livelihood recovery.The rainfall forecast indicates a timely start and generally positive cropping conditions, which is likely to lead to near-average 2017/18 crop production.

25144,"South Sudan entered the harvest season in September 2017 with 6 million people (56% of the total population) estimated to be severely food insecure , out of which 40,000 are in Humanitarian Catastrophe and 2 million are facing Emergency (IPC Phase 4) food insecurity. Post-harvest gains in October-December 2017 are expected to reduce the number of severely food insecure people to 4.8 million (45% of the total population), with 25,000 in Humanitarian Catastrophe. However, an anticipated earlier than normal start of the lean season will result in an estimated 5.1 million (48% of the total population) people being classified as severely food insecure in January-March 2018, with 20,000 in Humanitarian Catastrophe. In September 2017, there were populations in Humanitarian Catastrophe in all the three Greater regions of South Sudan. Specifically, populations in humanitarian catastrophe existed in Nyirol and Ayod counties of former Jonglei State; Kapoeta East of former Eastern Equatoria State; and Wau County of former Western Bahr el Ghazal State. In October-December 2017, populations will remain in Humanitarian Catastrophe in Wau and Ayod. In January-March 2018, Humanitarian Catastrophe is expected to persist only in Wau. Of great concern is Greater Baggari, a sub-area of former Wau County with an estimated population of 25 000, where 10% of the population is in Humanitarian Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5) in September 2017 as a result of sustained insecurity, sporadic humanitarian access since 2016, lack of freedom of movement and extreme depletion of livelihoods. Should these conditions persist, the food security situation is expected to deteriorate further. This calls for immediate and unhindered provision of humanitarian assistance and close monitoring. Acute malnutrition has worsened compared to the same period last year. Populations in Renk, Upper Nile, Twic, Warrap State and the Greater Baggari area in Wau former counties have Extreme Critical levels of acute malnutrition, while 31 counties in former Lakes State, former Northern Bah el Ghazal State, former Unity state, parts of former Jonglei State, former Western Bahr el Ghazal State and former Eastern Equatoria State, show Critical levels of acute malnutrition . Increases in Acute malnutrition is attributed to severe food insecurity, widespread insecurity, displacement, poor access to services, high morbidity, extremely poor diets and poor sanitation and hygiene. Levels of acute malnutrition are expected to improve marginally in September-December 2017 due to seasonal availability of local production, increased availability of fish and milk at the household level, and seasonal improved access to markets and services. Humanitarian assistance is critical in averting the situation deteriorating to catastrophic levels. Access to affected populations remains a challenge due to insecurity, with reported cases of access constraints increasing in 2017. IPC classifications already assume that a significant level of humanitarian assistance will occur according to plan, and any failure to provide this assistance would significantly increase the number of severely food insecure populations. In the worst case scenario, given the severity of the food security and nutrition situation observed during the 2017 lean season, continued conflict, humanitarian access constraints, climatic shocks and macro-economic instability leading up to the 2018 lean season will likely result in Famine (IPC Phase 5) conditions in multiple locations across South Sudan.",3

However, cumulative seasonal precipitation deficits remain significant in most areas, especially in the north and southwestern parts of the country. Despite increased precipitation in March and April, initial estimates from field reports indicate that area planted for rainfed wheat is smaller than last year, reflecting dry soil conditions and the use of extended areas for grazing.Maximum daily air temperatures have been above average since mid-season in most areas, and are expected to remain above average in the coming months. These abnormally high temperatures have led to early snowmelt across hydrological basins of the country, particularly in the southwest. Availability of irrigation water will be below average, and poor water availability is likely to adversely impact yields for some areas during the main season, and more broadly for second (dry) season irrigated production.• Forecasts indicate below-average to average precipitation for the remaining weeks of the spring wet season.

These attacks are generally close to the Somali border and are concentrated in Man- dera County in the extreme north east (see Figure 8).

When attacking the Mandera area, al-Shabaab typically launches raids from the adjacent Somali town of Bula Hawo, and often returns back to Somalia the same day. Over the past month, al-Shabaab’s focus has shifted to Lamu County in the south where a series of attacks caused nine civilian fatalities and a destroyed police post over the course of only a few days (The Independent, 8 July 2017). An emerging tactic of the group is the abduction of security personnel for ransom or to extract strategic informationfrom the abductees (Somali Update, 16 May, 2017). Oth- er al-Shabaab targets are telecommunication masts and other radio equipment, with the intention of cutting mili- tary communications between Mandera and the rest of the county.

14350,"Lassa fever is a viral haemorrhagic fever that is transmitted to humans via contact with food or household items contaminated with rodent urine or faeces. Person-to-person infections and laboratory transmission can also occur. The overall case fatality rate is 1%; it is 15% among patients hospitalized with severe illness. Early supportive care with rehydration and symptomatic treatment improves survival. The antiviral drug ribavirin seems to be an effective treatment for Lassa fever if given early on in the course of clinical illness. There is no evidence to support the role of ribavirin as post-exposure prophylactic treatment for Lassa fever. Lassa fever is known to be endemic in Benin, Guinea, Ghana, Liberia, Mali, Sierra Leone, Togo and Nigeria, and most likely exists in other West African countries.  The current Lassa fever outbreak in Nigeria shows an increasing trend in the number of cases and deaths in recent weeks with 317 confirmed cases reported in 2018 so far. This is the largest outbreak of Lassa fever ever reported in Nigeria.  The infection of 14 health care workers that were not working in Lassa fever case management centers highlights the urgent need to strengthen infection prevention and control practices in all health care setting for all patients, regardless of their presumed diagnosis. Given the high number of states affected, the clinical management will likely happen in health centers that are not appropriately prepared to care for patients affected by Lassa fever and the risk of infection in health care workers will increase.  The reporting of confirmed cases in different parts of the country and porous borders with neighbouring countries indicate a risk of spread nationally and to neighbouring countries. An overall moderate level of risk remains at the regional level. Public health actions should be focused on enhancing ongoing activities including surveillance, contact tracing, laboratory testing, and case management. Greater coordination and information sharing regarding Lassa fever cases and contacts with Benin would also contribute to rapid detection and response to cross-border spread of the outbreak",4

16241,"On September 17, gunfire erupted in Rio de Janeiro's Rocinha favela -- the city's largest -- as rival criminal groups battled for control of drug trafficking activities, according to local news outlets. The violence has continued in subsequent days. Dozens of alleged gang members have reportedly descended on Rocinha at the behest of Antonio Francisco Bonfim Lopes, alias 'Nem,' who led the Amigos dos Amigos gang in Rocinha before he was arrested in 2011. Nem has reportedly maintained control over drug trafficking operations in Rocinha from federal prison since his arrest. The impetus for the recent violence has been linked to a feud between Nem and his former bodyguard Rogério Avelino da Silva, alias 'Rogério 157.' Rogério 157 has reportedly broken from the ranks of Nem's Amigos dos Amigos gang and joined forces with the Red Command (Comando Vermelho) in an apparent attempt to assert greater control over the local drug trade. The ongoing battle -- which according to O Globo has featured grenades, hours-long gun battles and a bus being set on fire -- has severely impacted normal life for Rocinha's residents.

In Nigeria in particular, vigilantism did much to turn an anti-state insurgency into a bloodier civil war, pitting Boko Haram against communities and leading to drastic increases in violence. As the conflict continues to evolve, so will vigilantes. They are enmeshed with high politics, especially in Nigeria, and in local intercommunal relations, business operations and chiefdoms. Their belief that they should be rewarded will need to be addressed, and it is also important for the Lake Chad basin states to address the common gap in community policing, particularly in rural areas.

During this period 376 patients were confirmed, nine were classified as probable, 1084 tested negative and 26 are awaiting laboratory results (pending). Among the 376 cases classified as confirmed and nine classified as probable, 95 deaths were reported (case fatality rate for confirmed and probable cases = 24.7%).  From 1 January through 18 March, seventeen health care workers in six states (Benue, Ebonyi, Edo, Kogi, Nasarawa, and Ondo) have been infected, four of whom have died.  Since 1 January 2018, the number of Lassa fever cases increased from 10 to 70 weekly reported cases. However since mid-February, there has been a downward trend in the weekly reported number of Lassa fever cases.  Lassa fever case management centres are operational in three states (Ebonyi, Edo, and Ondo States). The health care workers working in these centres are trained in standard infection control and prevention (IPC) as well as use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and case management. In addition, the suspected cases and deaths reported in community settings are being actively investigated by the field teams and contacts are being followed up. Currently, three laboratories at Abuja, Irrua and Lagos are operational and testing samples for Lassa fever by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Phylogenetic analysis of 27 viruses detected during the 2018 outbreak, performed at Irrua and Bernard Nocht Institute, has shown evidence of multiple, independent introductions of different viruses and viruses similar to previously circulating lineages identified in Nigeria. This highlights the spillover from the rodent population rather than human to human transmission.  WHO continues to support the outbreak response, mainly in the domains of enhanced surveillance, contact tracing, strengthening of diagnostic capacity, case management, IPC and risk communication. In addition, WHO continues to work on standardizing treatment guidance across all treatment centres and on standardization of the reporting.  Lassa fever is endemic in the West African countries of Ghana, Guinea, Mali, Benin, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Togo and Nigeria.",4
12978,"Weak regulation regarding rangeland fragmentation also plays a part in weakening rangeland management. The Palestinian Land Authority (PLA) formulated a new land policy in 2008 but it was never authorized due to political constraints.19 As a result of weak regulation and multilayered legal systems in place, nearly 30% of agricultural plots in the West Bank are smaller than 0.3 hectares. In the Gaza Strip the land policy is more straightforward, but even so, 55% of plots are under 0.3 hectares. Thisreduces the efficiency of the land use, by leading to plots being too small for it to be worthwhile to use them, and to an individualized approach to management rather than a joint communal approach.20 In order to balance the size of the herd with the small plot of land available to them for grazing, herders have either sold their flocks altogether, or retained only a small flock. The limited access to public rangeland prevents the traditional pastoral economy from thriving. Herders who do not own land or own very small plots of land, who could have relied in the past on public herding land, cannot sustain their herds.",5

15787,"Uttarakhand which is considered reservoir for Indian subcontinent has faced drought in 10 out of 13 districts for two years from 2007-09 . With scant rainfall in winter, the state is likely to go through the situation of severe water crisis and forest fire. United Nations Development Program (UNDP) has laid bare the findings of its more intensified Drill Down Vulnerability Risk Assessment (VRS) conducted till December last year with regard to water crisis in the state.  Rashmi Bajaj, state project manager of UNDP said, “An estimated about 2.6 lakh springs provide 90% of the drinking water sources in Uttarakhand. Due to continued deforestation for projects like road construction, or to meet fuel and fodder demands of local communities, it was found after collecting information from various sources and communities that discharges of 500 water supply sources including springs , streams, ponds etc have reportedly reduced by more than 50%. Climate change will further amplify reduction of local water resources.”  She said, inherent nature of the resource, land-use changes, lack of scientific understanding, and climate variability all make springs further vulnerable to extinction. UNDP under the project “Strengthening State Strategies for Climate Actions”, which is funded by Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) will restore dried spring sheds in forest in collaboration with the forest department.  Subhrata Paul, expert with UNDP said, “Earlier VRS study was conducted at block level in 2016 but the drill down VRS study was conducted at community level in Dehradun, Haridwar, Champawat, Pauri and Tehri Garhwal. Champawat last year. Champawat accounts for the maximum number of villages, 85% along the slopes thereby making it more vulnerable to both water scarcity, precipitation induced landslides and non-climate hazard such as earthquake. Dehradun and Garhwal districts have highest water crisis cases, due to their poor surface water and ground water availability across the year.”  He said, water crisis in Pauri Garhwal district is one of the reasons for large scale outmigration. The report says that such problems have been reported to be most prominent in villages of Jaiharikhal, Dwarikhal and Dugadda blocks. In Jaunsar area of district Tehri Garhwal, in villages such as Nagthat, Duena, Vishoi, Gadol, Jandoh, Chi tar, Chichrad and Gangoa, the water is mostly acidic in nature. The water problem in Chitar and Gangoa villages is very severe, where men and women carry water on mules from 8-10 Km to the village.  “Remote sensing data of number of forest fire events in last 16 years indicates that Tehri Garhwal, Pauri Garhwal and Dehradun are more vulnerable to forest fires. Lack of water and reduced moisture in the forest floor are evidently one of the main reason for increased number of forest fire,” said Waseem Yousf, UNDP consultant.  DGK Sharma, additional principal chief conservator of Environment and Climate Change deparment said, “The state of Uttarakhand faces acute water scarcity during the peak summer season. As highlighted in the State Action Plan for Climate Change about 20% of the 15,165 villages have varied range of problems related to drinking water provision and more than 180 villages do not have a designated source.'

The Boko Haram-related insurgency has led to the internal displacement of 129,000 Nigeriens, while regional instability has forced Malians and Nigerians to cross into Niger in search of shelter and protection. As of March, the UN reported that Niger hosted approximately 57,100 Malian refugees and 108,500 Nigerian refugees.   ? The UN 2018 Humanitarian Response Plan for Niger requests $338 million to respond to humanitarian needs in the country. Nearly two-thirds of the budget represents food security and nutrition assistance; countrywide, the UN identifies 1.4 million and 1.7 million people who need food and nutrition support, respectively.   ? Civil insecurity and conflict have particularly disrupted livelihood activities, agricultural production, and trade in parts of Diffa Region, where Crisis (IPC 3) levels of acute food insecurity will persist until September 2018, according to the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET).* FEWS NET also projects that poor pasture conditions, low livestock prices, and an early pastoral lean season will likely result in Stressed (IPC 2) levels of food insecurity for some herding populations through July, with certain impoverished herders potentially experiencing Crisis acute food insecurity between June and July in the absence of humanitarian assistance. Additionally, some vulnerable agricultural households in southern Niger will likely experience Stressed levels of food insecurity until September due to inadequate crop production and prematurely depleted food stocks.

The retail price of maize in Qorioley in June was 10,750 SOS/kg, 50 percent above average and also the highest June price since 2011. Sustained high prices are attributed to below-average production in 2016 and traders withholding stocks from markets until August/September, when prices will be higher.- In most pastoral livelihood zones of Middle and Lower Juba, rainfall in mid-June and July improved pasture and water resources, which supported livestock body improvements.

Poor pastoralists from these regions will have increased access to milk and saleable livestock, and Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes are expected throughout the outlook period.- According to the Food Security Cluster (FSC), humanitarian organizations will distribute large-scale emergency assistance through December, targeting 1 million beneficiaries in August and 400,000-600,000 a month from September to December. This is below current levels of 2.5 million beneficiaries a month, though not all distribution plans were submitted to the FSC as of mid-July and actual targets may be higher.

This is likely to lead to higher income from livestock sales, particularly of goats.

These improvements will be less significant and short-lived in parts of Garissa, Tana River, Wajir, Mandera, and Isiolo where rainfall and rangeland resource regeneration were below average. As a result, household purchasing power is likely to be constrained by low incomes in these areas. Improvements in wage-earning opportunities like herding, are expected to improve but remain below average, and this also applies to conception rates and calving, lambing, and kidding levels in eastern areas of the country. Through mid-April 2018, milk production is expected to largely remain below average, and with households mostly depending on markets for food access , additional income sources, such as charcoal sales and remittances, will be relied upon to meet minimum food needs. The March – May long rains, though forecasted to be below average in parts of the northeast, are likely to begin in mid-March, bringing slight improvements in forage and water resources. While the resultant impacts are likely to remain below average, livestock body conditions and milk production will still increase.
